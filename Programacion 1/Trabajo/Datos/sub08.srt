1
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:43,449
"In the decade of the 1930s,
even the great city of Metropolis...

2
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,392
... was not spared the ravages
of the worldwide depression.

3
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:52,092
In the times of fear and confusion,
the job of informing the public...

4
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:55,135
... was the responsibility
of the Daily Planet...

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:01:00,675
... a great metropolitan newspaper,
whose reputation for clarity and truth...

6
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:05,804
... had become a symbol of hope
for the city of Metropolis. "

7
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:42,410
This is no fantasy...

8
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:46,282
...no careless product
of wild imagination.

9
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,118
No, my good friends...

10
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:56,354
These indictments
I have brought you today...

11
00:06:56,766 --> 00:07:01,726
...the specific charges listed herein
against the individuals...

12
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:06,534
...their acts of treason,
their ultimate aim of sedition...

13
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:15,214
...these are matters of undeniable fact.

14
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:22,488
I ask you now to pronounce judgment...

15
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,422
...on those accused.

16
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,598
On this...

17
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:38,138
This mindless aberration,
whose only means of expression...

18
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,537
...are wanton violence and destruction.

19
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:45,141
On the woman, Ursa...

20
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:48,875
...whose perversions
and unreasoning hatred of all mankind...

21
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,919
...have threatened even the children
of the planet Krypton.

22
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,922
Finally, General Zod.

23
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:07,298
Once trusted by this council...

24
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,099
...charged with maintaining the defense
of the planet Krypton itself.

25
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:13,538
Chief architect
of this intended revolution...

26
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:19,477
...and author of this insidious plot
to establish a new order amongst us...

27
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:23,243
...with himself as absolute ruler.

28
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:27,986
You have heard the evidence.

29
00:08:28,891 --> 00:08:31,325
The decision of the council
will now be heard.

30
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:32,825
Guilty.

31
00:08:33,796 --> 00:08:35,957
Guilty.

32
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,161
Guilty.

33
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,463
The vote must be unanimous, Jor-El.

34
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,931
It has therefore
now become your decision.

35
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,441
You alone will condemn us if you wish...

36
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,513
...and you alone
will be held responsible by me.

37
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,685
Join us.

38
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,926
You have been known to disagree
with the council before.

39
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:10,691
Yours could become an important voice
in the new order...

40
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,800
...second only to my own.

41
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:16,496
I offer you a chance for greatness, Jor-El!

42
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:19,800
Take it! Join us!

43
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:23,076
You will bow down before me, Jor-El.

44
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:24,508
I swear it.

45
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,583
No matter that it takes an eternity,
you will bow down before me!

46
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,083
Both you...

47
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:32,278
...and then one day...

48
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,753
...your heirs!

49
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,099
No!

50
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,728
- Let us out of here!
- Help me!

51
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,812
- Forgive me!
- I shall return!

52
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:07,380
Forgive me!

53
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,041
I shall return!

54
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:29,804
An unpleasant duty
has been masterly performed, Jor-El.

55
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:33,032
They have received the fate
they deserved.

56
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,734
Isolation in the Phantom Zone...

57
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:39,142
...an eternal living death.

58
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:42,545
A chance for life, nonetheless.

59
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,312
As opposed to us.

60
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:49,354
It's suicide. No, it's worse.

61
00:11:49,525 --> 00:11:50,753
It's genocide.

62
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,826
Be warned, Jor-El.

63
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:57,398
The council has already evaluated
this outlandish theory of yours.

64
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:02,834
My friends, you know me to be
neither rash nor impulsive.

65
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:07,999
I am not given to wild,
unsupported statements.

66
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,669
And I tell you that we must
evacuate this planet immediately.

67
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:15,741
Jor-El, you are one
of Krypton's greatest scientists.

68
00:12:15,918 --> 00:12:18,079
Yes, but so is Vond-Ah.

69
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,056
It isn't that they question your data.
The facts are undeniable.

70
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:34,191
It's your conclusions
we find unsupportable.

71
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:41,465
This planet will explode
within 30 days, if not sooner.

72
00:12:41,644 --> 00:12:44,169
I tell you, Krypton
is simply shifting its orbit.

73
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:48,278
Jor-El, be reasonable.

74
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,585
My friend...

75
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:54,782
...I have never been otherwise.

76
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,015
This madness is yours.

77
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,991
This discussion is terminated.

78
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:04,024
The decision of the council is final.

79
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:28,714
Any attempt by you to create a climate
of fear and panic among the populace...

80
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,952
...must be deemed by us
an act of insurrection.

81
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:36,222
You would accuse me of insurrection?

82
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:39,533
Has it now become a crime
to cherish life?

83
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:43,863
You would be banished
to endless imprisonment...

84
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,404
...in the Phantom Zone...

85
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,868
...the eternal void...

86
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:51,177
...which you yourself discovered.

87
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,882
Will you abide by the council's decision?

88
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:03,951
I will remain silent.

89
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:10,056
Neither I, nor my wife
will leave Krypton.

90
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,715
Have you finished?

91
00:15:10,092 --> 00:15:11,855
Nearly.

92
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,497
It's the only answer, Lara.

93
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:23,866
If he remains here with us
he will die as surely as we will.

94
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,370
But why Earth, Jor-El?

95
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,203
They're primitives
thousands of years behind us.

96
00:15:28,377 --> 00:15:31,073
He will need that advantage to survive.

97
00:15:33,248 --> 00:15:37,878
Their atmosphere will sustain him.

98
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,996
He will defy their gravity.

99
00:15:48,163 --> 00:15:50,563
He will look like one of them.

100
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:53,127
He won't be one of them.

101
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:54,997
No.

102
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,765
His dense molecular structure
will make him strong.

103
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:04,111
He'll be odd. Different.

104
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,374
He'll be fast. Virtually invulnerable.

105
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,282
Isolated, alone.

106
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:18,823
He will not be alone.

107
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,757
He will never be alone.

108
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:38,542
The energy input to Jor-El's quarters
is now in excess.

109
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:42,717
Our data indicates the loss
is due to a misuse of energy.

110
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,216
Investigate.

111
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,983
And if the investigation
proves correct?

112
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,051
He knew the penalty he faced.

113
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,854
He even is a member of this council.

114
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,233
The law will be upheld.

115
00:17:41,877 --> 00:17:46,576
You will travel far, my little Kal-El.

116
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:50,214
But we will never leave you...

117
00:17:50,953 --> 00:17:54,013
...even in the face of our deaths.

118
00:17:54,189 --> 00:18:00,185
The richness of our lives,
it will be yours.

119
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:05,063
All that I have, all that I've learned,
everything I feel...

120
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,059
...all this and more...

121
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:12,404
...I bequeath you, my son.

122
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:20,913
You will carry me inside you
all the days of your life.

123
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:28,053
You will make my strength your own,
see my life through your eyes...

124
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,283
...as your life will be seen through mine.

125
00:18:33,829 --> 00:18:37,993
The son becomes the father,
and the father the son.

126
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,597
This is all I...

127
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,036
All I can send you...

128
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,444
...Kal-El.

129
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:06,124
Stop. Stop, stop!

130
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:13,002
- which Einstein
called his theory of relativity.

131
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:18,203
Embedded in the crystals before you
is the total accumulation of all literature...

132
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,213
... and scientific fact
from dozens of other worlds...

133
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,648
... spanning the 28 known galaxies.

134
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:49,308
Early Chinese writings
point out the complex relationships...

135
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:55,047
By carrying this complex equation
to its ultimate power, my son...

136
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,686
Chief among these powers
will be your sight...

137
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,791
... your strength, your hearing...

138
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:08,760
... your ability to propel yourself
at almost limitless speed.

139
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,958
The early history of our universe
was a bloody mosaic of interplanetary war.

140
00:24:14,136 --> 00:24:17,037
Each of the six galaxies
which you will pass through...

141
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,038
... contain their own individual law,
space and time.

142
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:24,406
It is forbidden for you
to interfere with human history.

143
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:59,207
What was that?

144
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,572
Now, wouldn't that beat all get-out?

145
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,400
Will you... You...

146
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,376
Pa...

147
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,219
Oh, my.

148
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:13,811
All these years,
as happy as we've been...

149
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,820
...how I've prayed the good Lord...

150
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,585
...see fit to give us a child.

151
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:22,563
Honey, will you hand me
that rag up there.

152
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:24,221
You take things easy, Jonathan.

153
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,959
Remember what Doc Frye said
about that heart of yours.

154
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:36,843
Now the first thing we've got
to do when we get home is find out...

155
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,037
...who that boy's proper family is.

156
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:43,175
He hasn't got any.
Not around here, anyway.

157
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:49,650
Martha, are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

158
00:26:50,725 --> 00:26:54,923
We could say he's the child
of my cousin in North Dakota.

159
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:56,461
And just now orphaned.

160
00:26:58,233 --> 00:27:01,396
- Oh, Martha.
- Jonathan, he's only a baby.

161
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:05,335
Martha...
Now, you saw how we found him.

162
00:27:08,476 --> 00:27:11,639
Martha Clark Kent, are you
listening to what I'm saying?

163
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,345
Jonathan!

164
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,542
Come on, gang.

165
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,274
Come on.

166
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,181
- That was a great game, huh?
- Yeah, but next week we're...

167
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:54,516
All right.

168
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:57,124
Come on, gang, hustle. Let's go.

169
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,816
Stack your helmets neatly.

170
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:02,019
Remember about those uniforms.
Cleaned and washed by tomorrow...

171
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:04,222
...and looking like a football team.

172
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,367
Clark, have the clothes
washed and ready...

173
00:28:06,534 --> 00:28:08,126
...for tomorrow's game.
- Yes, sir.

174
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,668
Got to beat Mount Vernon High!

175
00:28:09,838 --> 00:28:12,773
- Can you give me a lift?
- Home early!

176
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:21,107
Lana? Don't bother with these, huh?

177
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,012
I'll take them in with
the other equipment.

178
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:26,983
- Thank you, Clark.
- Sure.

179
00:28:27,756 --> 00:28:30,554
Listen, a whole bunch of us
are going up to Mary Ellen's...

180
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,317
...play some records...

181
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:34,459
Would you like to come?

182
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,124
Sure. Sounds like it'd be a lot of fun.

183
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,962
Kent can't make it.
Still got a lot of work to do.

184
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,203
What are you talking about?
I just finished stacking all the...

185
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,772
All that?

186
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:49,207
Oh, Brad.

187
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:53,308
- Hey, come on, Lana.
- Come on, Lana.

188
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,176
Come on, let's go.

189
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,377
- He's got to clean up.
- Bye, Clark.

190
00:28:57,552 --> 00:29:00,214
- Yeah. Bye, Lana.
- Clean this up, Clark.

191
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:02,953
- Let's go.
- Bye, Clark.

192
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,752
- We're off to Mary Ellen's.
- See you, Clark.

193
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:07,928
All right.

194
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,655
- Bye, Clark.
- Bye, Clark.

195
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,097
Bye, Clark. See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

196
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:27,038
Golly, I saw a boy out there
run as fast as the train!

197
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:29,233
Faster even!

198
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,846
Lois Lane, you have
a writer's gift for invention.

199
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,039
- I'll say that for you.
- But... But...

200
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:38,447
Lois, please read your book.

201
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,310
No one ever believes me.

202
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,278
Hey, look. There's Clark.

203
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,787
How come he's here?

204
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,949
Clark.

205
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,822
How'd you get here so fast?

206
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:24,491
- I ran.
- Ran, huh?

207
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,829
Told you he's an oddball.
Let's get out of here.

208
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,269
Been showing off a bit,
haven't you, son?

209
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,819
I didn't mean to show off, Pa.

210
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:58,754
It's just that, guys like that Brad,
I just want to tear them apart.

211
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,798
Yeah. I know.

212
00:32:00,969 --> 00:32:03,062
- Yeah, I know I shouldn't.
- Yeah, I know...

213
00:32:03,237 --> 00:32:05,262
...you can do all these amazing things...

214
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,136
...and sometimes you think
that you will just go bust...

215
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,106
...unless you can tell people about it.

216
00:32:10,278 --> 00:32:13,076
Yeah. I mean, every time
I get the football...

217
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:16,148
...I can make a touchdown. Every time.
- That's for sure.

218
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,808
I mean, is it showing off
if somebody's doing...

219
00:32:18,987 --> 00:32:22,582
...the things he's capable of doing?
Is a bird showing off when it flies?

220
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:25,954
No. No, now you listen to me.

221
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:28,254
When you first came to us,
we thought people...

222
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:31,091
...would come take you away
because when they found out...

223
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:34,928
...you know, the things you could do,
and that worried us a lot.

224
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:38,004
Then a man gets older,
and he thinks very differently...

225
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:40,868
...and things get very clear.

226
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,906
And there's one thing I do know, son...

227
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:46,513
...and that is you are here for a reason.

228
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:49,081
I don't know whose reason,
but whatever the reason...

229
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:51,218
...maybe it's because...

230
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:56,718
I don't know, it's...

231
00:32:58,493 --> 00:33:00,290
But I do know one thing:

232
00:33:00,461 --> 00:33:03,123
It's not to score touchdowns.

233
00:33:05,466 --> 00:33:06,956
Thanks, Dad.

234
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:10,236
I'll race you to it. Dad.

235
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,396
- You will, huh?
- Come on. Come on, Pop, run.

236
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,804
Come on. Move. Move.
Yeah, go, go, go. Come on, run.

237
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:19,276
Hey, Baron! Hey, Baron. Hey, boy.

238
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:28,087
Oh, no.

239
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,999
Jonathan.

240
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,203
Jonathan!

241
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:57,284
Dad.

242
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,819
No!

243
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:06,126
Jonathan!

244
00:34:08,196 --> 00:34:10,027
No!

245
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,132
All those things I can do...

246
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,664
All those powers...

247
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,676
And I couldn't even save him.

248
00:37:58,225 --> 00:38:01,023
Clark, get up.

249
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,729
Good morning, Smiley.

250
00:38:07,835 --> 00:38:10,429
Clark, breakfast.

251
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,700
Are you gonna sleep all day?

252
00:38:17,745 --> 00:38:21,044
Clark, come on. Get up.

253
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,839
I have to leave.

254
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:31,116
I knew this time would come.

255
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,647
We both knew it...

256
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:35,948
...from the day we found you.

257
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,363
I talked to Ben Hubbard yesterday...

258
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:55,870
...and he said that he'd be happy
to help out from now on.

259
00:40:04,085 --> 00:40:05,643
Mother...

260
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,645
I know, son.

261
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:12,052
I know.

262
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,288
Do you know where you're headed?

263
00:40:23,137 --> 00:40:24,570
North.

264
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:31,935
Remember us, son.

265
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:35,578
Always remember us.

266
00:46:12,085 --> 00:46:14,212
My son...

267
00:46:20,627 --> 00:46:23,061
... you do not remember me.

268
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:25,726
I am Jor-El.

269
00:46:26,767 --> 00:46:28,234
I'm your father.

270
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,798
By now, you will have reached
your 18th year...

271
00:46:33,974 --> 00:46:36,602
... as it is measured on Earth.

272
00:46:36,777 --> 00:46:40,235
By that reckoning,
I will have been dead...

273
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:43,679
... for many thousands of your years.

274
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,319
The knowledge...

275
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:51,049
... that I have,
matters physical and historic...

276
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:55,423
... I've given you fully on your voyage
to your new home.

277
00:46:55,596 --> 00:47:01,034
These are important matters, to be sure,
but still matters of mere fact.

278
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:05,369
There are questions to be asked.

279
00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,270
And it is time for you to do so.

280
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:12,908
Here in this...

281
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:17,216
This Fortress of Solitude...

282
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:20,646
... we shall try to find
the answers together.

283
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,050
So, my son...

284
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:26,783
... speak.

285
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:29,557
Who am I?

286
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:32,191
Your name is Kal-El.

287
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,664
You are the only survivor
of the planet Krypton.

288
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,561
Even though you've been
raised as a human being...

289
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,605
... you are not one of them.

290
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,437
You have great powers...

291
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,707
... only some of which
you have as yet discovered.

292
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:52,709
Come with me now, my son...

293
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:55,719
... as we break through the bonds
of your earthly confinement.

294
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:59,381
Traveling through time and space
in the six known dimensions.

295
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,927
Your powers will far exceed
those of mortal men.

296
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:06,190
It is forbidden for you to interfere
with human history.

297
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:10,097
Rather, let your leadership
stir others to.

298
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:16,308
In this next year, we shall
examine the human heart.

299
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:19,172
It is more fragile than your own.

300
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:20,574
For the past two years...

301
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:25,241
As we pass through the flaming turmoil
which is the edge of your own galaxy...

302
00:48:25,419 --> 00:48:27,785
... we'll enter the realm
of the red Krypton sun...

303
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:30,549
... source of your strength
and nourishment...

304
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:33,454
... cause of our eventual destruction.

305
00:48:34,461 --> 00:48:37,453
The planet Krypton, my son.

306
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,998
Your home, as it was.

307
00:48:42,102 --> 00:48:46,198
This year, we shall examine
the various concepts of immortality...

308
00:48:46,373 --> 00:48:49,137
... and their basis in actual fact.

309
00:48:49,443 --> 00:48:54,005
The total accumulation of all knowledge,
spanning the 28 known galaxies...

310
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,548
... is embedded in the crystals
which I have sent along with you.

311
00:48:57,718 --> 00:48:59,743
Study them well, my son...

312
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,753
... and learn from them.
We've reasoned out logical judgments.

313
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:06,324
By the time you return
to the confines of your galaxy...

314
00:49:06,493 --> 00:49:09,223
... twelve of your years will have passed.

315
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:14,356
For this reason, among others,
I have chosen Earth for you.

316
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,833
It is now time for you
to rejoin your new world...

317
00:49:18,005 --> 00:49:21,736
... and to serve its collective humanity.

318
00:49:21,908 --> 00:49:24,376
Live as one of them, Kal-El...

319
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:28,071
... to discover where your strength
and your power are needed.

320
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:33,948
Always hold in your heart
the pride of your special heritage.

321
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:37,454
They can be a great people, Kal-El.
They wish to be.

322
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:41,119
They only lack the light to show the way.

323
00:49:42,195 --> 00:49:46,427
For this reason above all,
their capacity for good...

324
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:49,128
... I have sent them you...

325
00:49:50,671 --> 00:49:52,605
... my only son.

326
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,373
Okay, this is it, mac, the Daily Planet.

327
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,570
Fresh fruit. Hey, lady,
how about a tomato?

328
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:35,647
Fresh fruit.
Hey, baby, how's it going?

329
00:50:35,816 --> 00:50:40,116
Hey, fresh fruit and vegetables.
They're so fresh...

330
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:43,414
Fresh fruit and vegetables.
Get them while they're hot.

331
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:46,115
Look at these tomatoes.
Aren't they beautiful?

332
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:01,570
He did a great job.
You see his article this morning?

333
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,012
Smile.

334
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:17,089
- How many T's in "bloodletting"?
- Two.

335
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:25,463
- What are you writing, Miss Lane?
- An ode to spring.

336
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,657
How do you spell "massacre"?

337
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:32,134
- M-A-S-S-A-C-R-E.
- A... C...

338
00:51:32,305 --> 00:51:34,034
...R- E. Thank you.

339
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:36,437
Golly, how come you get
all the great stories?

340
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:38,840
A good reporter doesn't
get great stories, Jimmy.

341
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,536
A good reporter makes them great.

342
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:42,682
Here's that story on the East Side murder.

343
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,943
I see it as a banner headline,
front page, maybe my picture...

344
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:49,213
There's only one P in "rapist."
Lois Lane, say hello to Clark Kent.

345
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:51,687
- Told you one P.
- Hello, Miss Lane. How are...?

346
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,190
Remember my exposé
on the sex and drug orgies...

347
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,919
...in the senior citizens home?

348
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:58,087
How you doing?
Jimmy Olsen, photographer.

349
00:51:58,265 --> 00:52:01,166
- Oh, hi. Clark Kent. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

350
00:52:01,334 --> 00:52:04,394
It's got everything. It's got sex,
violence, the ethnic angle...

351
00:52:04,571 --> 00:52:07,005
So does a lady wrestler
with a foreign accent.

352
00:52:07,174 --> 00:52:09,472
- Kent, can you open this?
- Oh, sure, Mr. White.

353
00:52:09,643 --> 00:52:11,270
This could be a series of articles:

354
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:14,504
"Making Sense of Senseless Killings,"
by Lois Lane.

355
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:17,206
We get psychologists, sociologists...

356
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,945
Lois, you're pushing a bunch
of rinky-dink tabloid garbage.

357
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:23,783
- The Daily Planet has a tradition...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

358
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:27,517
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to shake it up like that.

359
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,662
Oh, of course not, Lois.

360
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:33,357
Why would anyone want to make
a total stranger look like a fool?

361
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:38,036
- I'll take that.
- Oh, thank... I'm sorry, Mr. White.

362
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:41,902
Olsen, why am I paying you when I should
have you arrested for loitering?

363
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,667
- Go get Mr... A towel.
- Kent.

364
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:45,277
- Move, kid, move.
- Right, chief.

365
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:47,345
- Make mine black, no sugar.
- Right, chief.

366
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:49,914
- And don't call me sugar.
- "Blood is in Metropolis...

367
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,142
- Right, sugar.
...while the crocuses bloom."

368
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,482
Chief wants coffee, no sugar.
I'll take tea with lemon.

369
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:59,284
Lois, why don't you take Kent
out to meet everybody, huh?

370
00:52:59,459 --> 00:53:02,656
Just introduce him around.
He's starting with the paper today.

371
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:04,262
I'm giving him the city beat.

372
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:08,228
Chief, that's my beat.

373
00:53:08,401 --> 00:53:12,735
Lois, Clark Kent may seem like just
a mild-mannered reporter, but listen...

374
00:53:12,906 --> 00:53:16,307
...not only does he know how to treat
his editor in chief with respect...

375
00:53:16,476 --> 00:53:19,036
...not only does he have a snappy,
punchy prose style...

376
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:23,080
...but he is, in my 40 years in this business,
the fastest typist I've ever seen.

377
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,842
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

378
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:27,316
Here, you forgot my article.

379
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:31,517
Oh, excuse me, Mr. White?

380
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:34,956
I was wondering if perhaps
you could arrange for half my salary...

381
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,029
...to be sent to this address
on a weekly basis.

382
00:53:38,198 --> 00:53:39,790
- Your bookie, right?
- My what?

383
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:44,062
Don't tell me, he sends a check every week
to his sweet, gray-haired old mother.

384
00:53:44,237 --> 00:53:46,228
Actually, she's silver-haired.

385
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:50,100
I'll see what I can do.

386
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:52,837
Thank you very much, Mr. White.

387
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:54,679
Excuse me.

388
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,208
Well...

389
00:53:59,286 --> 00:54:00,810
Any more at home like you?

390
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,114
Not really, no.

391
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,650
I didn't think so.

392
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:12,255
- Well, get yourself a desk over here.
- Over here?

393
00:54:12,432 --> 00:54:15,367
Yeah, right here.
There are some papers in a pile...

394
00:54:15,802 --> 00:54:18,737
Sorry. Excuse me.

395
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:36,449
- Hi, Bill Breesen.
- Hi, Clark Kent.

396
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:39,148
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome aboard.

397
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:42,823
- Here's your towel, Mr. Clark.
- Kent.

398
00:54:42,996 --> 00:54:44,987
- What?
- Kent.

399
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:47,725
- Clark Kent.
- Jimmy Olsen.

400
00:54:51,671 --> 00:54:53,138
- Yeah. It's fantastic.
- So you...?

401
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,774
- I met this really great guy.
- Hey, fabulous.

402
00:54:55,942 --> 00:54:58,001
Yeah, fabulous.
I met him at this dude ranch.

403
00:54:58,178 --> 00:55:01,079
- Did...? I used to ride.
- Yeah, I haven't been since I was 7.

404
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,307
- Oh, I gotta mail these letters.
- Okay, bye. Good luck tonight.

405
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:05,974
- Oh, hi, Clark.
- Hi, Lois.

406
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:07,949
How did you like your first day?

407
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:11,682
Well, frankly, the hours
were sort of longer than I expected...

408
00:55:11,858 --> 00:55:15,294
...but on the whole, I mean, meeting you
and Jimmy Olsen and Mr. White...

409
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:17,089
...gosh, I'd say it's been swell.

410
00:55:17,263 --> 00:55:19,788
- Swell?
- Yeah.

411
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:25,330
You know, Clark, there are very few people
left in the world...

412
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:27,632
...who feel comfortable
saying that word.

413
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:29,138
- What word?
- "Swell."

414
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:31,903
Really? I always thought
it was kind of natural.

415
00:55:33,947 --> 00:55:36,245
- I'm sorry.
- Clark.

416
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,043
It's all right.

417
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:40,517
- Sorry, Lois.
- Oh, hi, Rex.

418
00:55:40,687 --> 00:55:42,382
- Oh, Lois.
- See anything good today?

419
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:44,079
- Not until you came along.
- Lois?

420
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,952
- Oh, Rex, this is...
- Clark Kent.

421
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:48,594
- Yeah, hi, see you around.
- Bye.

422
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:53,265
- Lois?
- Hey, where you going?

423
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:56,095
- Can I help you with your coat?
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

424
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:59,070
- So you like Mr. White.
- I thought he was a nice guy.

425
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:01,867
- Jimmy Olsen was fantastic.
- Hey, come here.

426
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:04,476
Come on, come on. Get in here.
Hurry up. Come on.

427
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:07,738
- We'd better get out of here.
- I think we'd better do what he says.

428
00:56:07,914 --> 00:56:11,042
- Come on, come on. Get in here, quick.
- Don't do anything.

429
00:56:11,217 --> 00:56:12,616
- That's it.
- We're coming.

430
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,845
- Come on.
- We're coming. Excuse me.

431
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:16,283
- Go on, back there.
- Here?

432
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:18,356
Please don't point that at me, sir.

433
00:56:18,525 --> 00:56:20,857
- You could hurt somebody with that.
- Yeah, yeah.

434
00:56:21,027 --> 00:56:23,894
- Okay, okay, hold it there.
- Just a minute, mister.

435
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:27,090
I realize of course that times
are tough for some these days...

436
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:28,757
...but this isn't the answer.

437
00:56:28,935 --> 00:56:33,065
You can't solve society's problems
with a gun.

438
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,335
You know something, buddy? You're right.
I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.

439
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:41,446
Good for you, sir. That's the spirit.
He doesn't really want to hurt anybody.

440
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,916
- Right after I rip off this lady's purse.
- Of course.

441
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:47,053
Now come on, lady, hand it over.

442
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,848
Lois, I think maybe you better...

443
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,451
Lois, what are you doing?

444
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,844
Clark! Clark.

445
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,209
Clark, are you all right? Clark!

446
00:57:16,382 --> 00:57:18,213
What happened?

447
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,611
Golly. I guess I must have fainted.

448
00:57:20,787 --> 00:57:22,482
Fainted?

449
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:25,215
- You fainted?
- Sorry.

450
00:57:36,903 --> 00:57:38,302
Swell.

451
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:41,065
Really, Lois, supposing that man
had shot you?

452
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:45,473
Is it worth risking your life over $ 10,
two credit cards, a hairbrush, and lipstick?

453
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:48,937
- How did you know that?
- Know what?

454
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,080
You just described the exact contents
of my purse.

455
00:57:56,689 --> 00:57:58,418
Wild guess.

456
00:58:01,461 --> 00:58:02,985
Taxi!

457
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:09,733
- Hey.
- Hi, Otis.

458
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:23,244
- So, what's happening, partner?
- Look what we got.

459
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,850
- Let's take him.
- Wait a minute.

460
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,852
Maybe he'll lead us
to the big man himself.

461
00:58:29,022 --> 00:58:32,423
- Lex Luthor?
- You got it, Armus.

462
00:58:32,992 --> 00:58:35,324
We'll make captain by midnight.

463
00:58:36,829 --> 00:58:38,558
Hey, what do you read?

464
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:41,291
XK-101 rocket to be used.

465
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:43,025
Hey, what do you read?

466
00:58:43,203 --> 00:58:44,761
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey, hey, Otis.

467
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,133
Just getting the Daily Planet here.

468
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,304
Hey, what do you read?
Down, down.

469
00:58:51,477 --> 00:58:53,240
Okay, okay.

470
00:58:53,413 --> 00:58:57,042
Okay. All right. See, I'm paying him.
I got a pretzel too.

471
00:58:57,217 --> 00:59:00,778
Thanks, Otis. Okay.
How many did he take, Shutzy?

472
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,490
This is Metropolis 46. We're on foot.
Over and out.

473
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:08,183
Let's go.

474
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:14,728
Your attention, please.

475
00:59:14,901 --> 00:59:16,596
Your attention, please.

476
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:20,170
The Metropolis Flyer is now
ready for departure...

477
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,538
... on the upper level, track six,
stopping at New Rochelle.

478
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:27,942
All right, he's going down
to the train platform. I'm going after him.

479
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:30,514
Okay, Harry. I'll call for backup.
Be careful, now.

480
00:59:30,683 --> 00:59:33,117
- All right, Armus, all right.
- All aboard, please.

481
00:59:34,887 --> 00:59:37,378
Now boarding on the lower level...

482
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:39,855
Ten minutes, folks.
Come on, air-conditioned cars.

483
00:59:40,026 --> 00:59:42,460
Mount Vernon, Poughkeepsie, Glen Corners.

484
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:45,120
Aboard now. All aboard.
Metropolis Transportation.

485
00:59:45,298 --> 00:59:48,734
Metropolis Transportation.
Buffalo, Syracuse.

486
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:51,734
Smoking cars are forward.
Move along, now.

487
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,337
Put your luggage up the top.

488
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:57,169
Smoking cars forward.
All aboard. Boarding.

489
01:00:24,904 --> 01:00:27,566
Armus, Armus, make it track 22.

490
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:31,904
I seen him, and I'm right on him.
Lower level, track 22.

491
01:01:08,281 --> 01:01:09,305
So that's it.

492
01:01:25,531 --> 01:01:29,490
It's amazing that brain can generate
enough power to keep those legs moving.

493
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,001
Harry.

494
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,874
Harry, where are you? Harry.

495
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:27,249
Oh, no.

496
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,624
Harry...

497
01:02:37,737 --> 01:02:39,364
Sick.

498
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:51,181
- Sick. You're really sick.
- Sick, Miss Teschmacher?

499
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,581
Sick, when I'm mere days from executing
the crime of the century?

500
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:57,723
No, no, no. Step away from that, please.

501
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:02,756
How do you choose to congratulate
the greatest criminal mind of our time?

502
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:05,626
Do you tell me that I'm brilliant?
Oh, no, no.

503
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:08,130
That would be too obvious, I grant you.

504
01:03:08,301 --> 01:03:11,998
Charismatic. Fiendishly gifted.

505
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:13,900
Try "twisted."

506
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,273
Get away from there.
Get away, get away, get away!

507
01:03:23,816 --> 01:03:25,306
Tell me something, Lex.

508
01:03:25,485 --> 01:03:28,386
Why do so many people have to die
for the crime of the century?

509
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:30,351
Why? You ask why?

510
01:03:30,523 --> 01:03:33,515
Why does the phone always ring
when you're in the bathtub?

511
01:03:34,827 --> 01:03:38,729
Why is the most brilliantly
diabolical leader of our time...

512
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:41,025
...surrounding himself
with total nincompoops?

513
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,065
I'm back, Mr. Luthor.

514
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,830
Yes, I was just talking about you.

515
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:47,966
You were followed again.

516
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:55,011
In spite of those catlike reflexes.

517
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:00,883
Mr. Luthor. Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry.

518
01:04:01,053 --> 01:04:02,486
Otis.

519
01:04:03,456 --> 01:04:05,617
Is that the newspaper
I asked you to get me?

520
01:04:06,459 --> 01:04:07,687
Yeah.

521
01:04:08,361 --> 01:04:10,329
Why am I not reading it?

522
01:04:11,964 --> 01:04:13,932
Because I haven't given it to you yet?

523
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,499
Right.

524
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,207
At last, it's official.

525
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,435
Thanks to the government,
we will pull off...

526
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,876
...the greatest real-estate swindle
of all time.

527
01:04:29,048 --> 01:04:31,448
Lex, what is this obsession
with real estate?

528
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:33,517
All the time, "land, land, land."

529
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:36,712
Miss Teschmacher, when I was 6 years old,
my father said to me...

530
01:04:36,889 --> 01:04:38,117
"Get out."

531
01:04:39,425 --> 01:04:43,418
Before that. He said,
"Son, stocks may rise and fall.

532
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:45,860
Utilities and transportation systems
may collapse.

533
01:04:46,032 --> 01:04:48,967
People are no damn good.
But they will always need land...

534
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,433
...and they'll pay through the nose
to get it."

535
01:04:51,604 --> 01:04:53,401
"Remember," my father said...

536
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:55,473
- Land.
- Right.

537
01:04:57,109 --> 01:05:00,738
It's a pity that he didn't see
from such humble beginnings...

538
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:02,540
...how I've created this empire.

539
01:05:02,715 --> 01:05:04,205
An empire? This?

540
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:07,611
Miss Teschmacher,
how many girls do you know...

541
01:05:07,787 --> 01:05:10,051
...who have a Park Avenue address
like this one?

542
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:12,019
Park Avenue address?

543
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,886
Two hundred feet below.

544
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:16,722
Do you realize what people
are shelling out up there...

545
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:19,888
...for a few miserable rooms
off a common elevator?

546
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:22,864
- What more could anyone ask?
- What more could anyone ask?

547
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:29,906
- Olsen!
- Yeah?

548
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:33,136
Get this Loch Ness update
right into Composing.

549
01:05:33,412 --> 01:05:37,178
Yeah? No, that's it, Roth.
Put it to bed. Right.

550
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,376
- What are you standing around here for?
- I'm not...

551
01:05:40,553 --> 01:05:43,147
- I wasn't gonna say it.
- Go.

552
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:49,793
- The sex maniac profile.
- Right.

553
01:05:49,962 --> 01:05:52,624
Look, 9-5 it's a Pulitzer Prize winner.
What do you bet?

554
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:54,527
There's no Z in "brassiere."

555
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,998
Hey, nice job on that union scandal, Kent.

556
01:05:57,169 --> 01:05:59,296
Well, gosh, thanks, Mr. White.

557
01:06:03,476 --> 01:06:04,966
Oh, hi, Clark. Good night.

558
01:06:05,144 --> 01:06:07,874
- Here, let me carry that for you.
- Oh, thanks a lot.

559
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,072
Lois, have you got a minute?

560
01:06:10,249 --> 01:06:12,479
Excuse me, please. Lois?

561
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:16,019
And these two go to the addresses
on the envelope, okay?

562
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:19,089
Lois, I was wondering if you
would like to have dinner with me?

563
01:06:19,258 --> 01:06:21,886
Gosh, Clark, I'm sorry. I'm booked.

564
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,928
Air Force One's landing at the airport
and this kid's there...

565
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:28,760
...to make sure you-know-who answers
a few questions he'd rather duck.

566
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:31,402
- My goodness, don't you ever let up?
- What for?

567
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,539
I've seen how the other half lives.
My sister, for instance.

568
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:37,699
Three kids, two cats, and one mortgage.

569
01:06:37,877 --> 01:06:39,367
I would go bananas in a week.

570
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:41,172
Oh, can I take you to the airport?

571
01:06:41,347 --> 01:06:43,577
Not unless you can fly.

572
01:06:44,116 --> 01:06:46,676
- Clark? Ladies.
- Sorry.

573
01:06:46,852 --> 01:06:50,754
- Change my clothes. Thank you. Bye.
- Hey, Lois, maybe we could...?

574
01:06:56,062 --> 01:06:57,427
Lois?

575
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,327
- Would you be a pet and mail that for me?
- Oh, sure... Good night.

576
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,466
Going down, please. Going down.

577
01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:16,542
- Going down?
- Going up, up, up.

578
01:07:17,883 --> 01:07:19,350
Good night.

579
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,761
- Daily Planet Copter One, this is ground.
- Planet One, go ahead.

580
01:07:34,934 --> 01:07:39,132
We have Miss Lane here for a quick ride
to Metropolis Airport to meet Air Force One.

581
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:41,603
Roger, we're on our way
and have you in sight.

582
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:43,901
Have one aboard for transfer, over.

583
01:07:44,076 --> 01:07:47,045
Roger, Planet One. You're cleared.
Wind, 0-2-0 at 1-5, gusting.

584
01:07:47,213 --> 01:07:51,047
- Altimeter 2-niner-8-niner.
- Roger, over and out.

585
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,044
A malfunction. Can't get liftoff.

586
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,578
- You hooked the tail.
- What's happening?

587
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:58,547
- Set it down.
- Oh, my God!

588
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:01,277
We've lost stabilizer rotor control,
I can't hold it!

589
01:09:06,659 --> 01:09:08,752
I can't hold it! I can't hold it!

590
01:09:26,278 --> 01:09:27,802
Wake up!

591
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,615
Help!

592
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:35,652
Help! Help!

593
01:09:50,336 --> 01:09:52,497
Come on, step back. Step back, folks.

594
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,868
All right, let's get back a little.
Move over across the street.

595
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:00,573
Bring the cameras over here. Okay.

596
01:10:00,746 --> 01:10:03,237
Okay, you see the helicopter up there?

597
01:10:09,722 --> 01:10:11,246
Help me!

598
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:21,395
All right, move back.
Let the ambulance through.

599
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,432
There's somebody in there!

600
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:28,406
Help me!

601
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,174
Okay. Come on, hold it. Get back.

602
01:10:38,918 --> 01:10:41,716
Come on. Come on, get off the streets.
Come on, get back.

603
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:44,788
Move, let the firemen through.

604
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:47,187
Boys, come on, now. Make a line.

605
01:10:52,698 --> 01:10:54,563
Move to the other side of the street.

606
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:57,766
Come on. Get along.

607
01:10:57,937 --> 01:10:59,302
Get away from the building.

608
01:11:01,874 --> 01:11:04,035
Hold these crowds back. Move. Move.

609
01:11:06,412 --> 01:11:07,902
Help me!

610
01:11:23,629 --> 01:11:26,598
- Say, Jim, whoa!
- Excuse me.

611
01:11:26,765 --> 01:11:28,562
That's a bad outfit.

612
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:31,736
Okay, Bresslaw, move these people out.

613
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:43,205
Oh, God, look up there.

614
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:45,878
What the hell's that?

615
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,415
Easy, miss. I've got you.

616
01:11:49,588 --> 01:11:51,283
You... You've got me?

617
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:53,515
Who's got you?

618
01:11:54,193 --> 01:11:58,289
I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it.
He got her.

619
01:12:43,042 --> 01:12:45,067
Gentlemen, this man needs help.

620
01:12:46,912 --> 01:12:50,905
Well, I certainly hope this little incident
hasn't put you off flying, miss.

621
01:12:51,817 --> 01:12:56,254
Statistically speaking, of course,
it's still the safest way to travel.

622
01:12:56,555 --> 01:12:58,955
Right. Wait.

623
01:13:03,929 --> 01:13:05,226
Who are you?

624
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:07,429
A friend.

625
01:13:12,404 --> 01:13:14,269
Bye.

626
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:57,196
You enjoyed it.

627
01:19:59,776 --> 01:20:01,710
I don't know what to say, Father.

628
01:20:01,879 --> 01:20:03,813
I'm afraid I just got carried away.

629
01:20:04,848 --> 01:20:08,614
- I anticipated this, my son.
- You couldn't have.

630
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:11,447
You couldn't have imagined...

631
01:20:11,922 --> 01:20:13,412
How good it felt?

632
01:20:15,993 --> 01:20:18,587
You are revealed to the world.

633
01:20:20,030 --> 01:20:22,430
Very well. So be it.

634
01:20:23,834 --> 01:20:27,099
But you still must keep
your secret identity.

635
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:28,329
Why?

636
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:30,730
The reasons are two.

637
01:20:30,908 --> 01:20:34,105
First: You cannot serve humanity
28 hours a day.

638
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:38,004
- 24.
- Or 24...

639
01:20:38,181 --> 01:20:41,446
... as it is in Earth time.

640
01:20:41,618 --> 01:20:44,109
Your help would be called for endlessly.

641
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:48,315
Even for those tasks which human beings
could solve themselves.

642
01:20:48,492 --> 01:20:52,223
Because they're happy to abuse
their resources in such a way.

643
01:20:52,396 --> 01:20:53,522
And secondly?

644
01:20:53,697 --> 01:20:54,823
Second:

645
01:20:54,998 --> 01:20:57,523
Your enemies will discover...

646
01:20:57,701 --> 01:20:59,828
... their only way to hurt you:

647
01:21:00,003 --> 01:21:02,301
By hurting the people you care for.

648
01:21:03,573 --> 01:21:04,835
Thank you, Father.

649
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:06,942
Lastly:

650
01:21:08,612 --> 01:21:11,706
Do not punish yourself
with your feelings of vanity.

651
01:21:11,882 --> 01:21:13,713
Simply learn to control them.

652
01:21:14,117 --> 01:21:17,780
It is an affliction common to all,
even on Krypton.

653
01:21:17,955 --> 01:21:21,152
Our destruction could have been avoided
but for the vanity of some...

654
01:21:21,325 --> 01:21:24,522
... who consider us indestructible.

655
01:21:24,695 --> 01:21:27,528
Were it not for vanity, why...

656
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:30,422
... at this very moment...

657
01:21:33,937 --> 01:21:36,872
... I could embrace you in my arms...

658
01:21:40,944 --> 01:21:42,411
... my son.

659
01:22:13,143 --> 01:22:14,235
Reports are coming in of...

660
01:22:14,411 --> 01:22:17,812
- ... a miraculous saving of Air Force One...
- A burglar was apprehended...

661
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:21,508
- ... by a man in a blue suit and red cape.
- ... rescuing Miss Lois Lane...

662
01:22:21,685 --> 01:22:24,620
... writer on the Daily Planet,
with one hand, and a...

663
01:22:30,027 --> 01:22:33,019
Yeah, that'll be the day, huh?

664
01:22:33,196 --> 01:22:36,131
I said, that'll be the day
when a guy could fly, huh?

665
01:22:36,299 --> 01:22:39,393
Oh, I don't know.
You'd be surprised.

666
01:22:42,539 --> 01:22:44,973
- fantastic hoax.
Your guess is as good as anybody's.

667
01:22:45,142 --> 01:22:47,406
True or false, miracle or fraud?

668
01:22:47,577 --> 01:22:49,738
- The answer to that...
- Miss Teschmacher!

669
01:22:50,547 --> 01:22:52,310
Turn it off.

670
01:22:59,189 --> 01:23:03,091
Lex, what's the story on this guy?

671
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,160
Do you think he's the genuine article?

672
01:23:05,328 --> 01:23:08,525
- If he is, he's not from this world.
- Why?

673
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:11,826
If any human being were gonna
perpetrate such a fantastic hoax...

674
01:23:12,002 --> 01:23:13,867
...it would have been me.

675
01:23:22,712 --> 01:23:25,704
Otis! My robe!
