1
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,736
All right, Charlie.

2
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:17,641
- That the joint? Who runs it?
- I already told you.

3
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,684
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

4
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,888
- What's the password?
- "I've come to Grandma's funeral."

5
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:25,443
- Your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

6
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:28,776
If you want a ringside table,
just say you're a pallbearer.

7
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,697
We're all set. When's the kickoff?

8
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:34,023
I'd better blow. If Colombo sees me,
it's goodbye, Charlie.

9
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,999
Goodbye, Charlie.

10
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,581
Give me five minutes,
then hit 'em with everything you got.

11
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,557
You betcha.

12
00:04:57,157 --> 00:04:58,749
Good evening, sir.

13
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,168
- I'm Mr Mozarella. What can I do for you?
- I've come to the old lady's funeral.

14
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:04,577
I haven't seen you at our services before.

15
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,227
- No, I've been on the wagon.
- Please.

16
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,437
Where is the wake?
I'm one of the pallbearers.

17
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:12,320
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

18
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,360
Yes, Mr Mozarella. This way, sir.

19
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:34,519
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

20
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,497
Follow me, please.

21
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,702
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

22
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,394
- Sorry. We only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

23
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:56,114
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee...

24
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:58,965
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

25
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,825
Wait a minute. Haven't you got
a pew not so close to the band?

26
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,527
How about that one over there?

27
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:08,458
Sorry, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

28
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:19,406
Oops.

29
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:27,919
Hey, I want another cup of coffee.

30
00:06:27,984 --> 00:06:30,918
I want another cup of coffee.

31
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,746
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

32
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,748
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people don't respect the dead.

33
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:12,996
Say, Joe. Tonight's the night, isn't it?

34
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:16,127
- I'll say.
- No, tonight we get paid.

35
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:19,775
- Why?
- I've got to see a dentist tomorrow.

36
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:22,593
You wanna blow
your first week's pay on your teeth?

37
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,993
Just a filling. Doesn't have to be gold.

38
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:30,808
How can you be so selfish? We owe rent.
We owe $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

39
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:35,036
The Chinese laundry is suing us.
We owe money to every girl in the line.

40
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:39,065
You're right. Tomorrow we'll pay
everyone something on account.

41
00:07:39,137 --> 00:07:44,373
No. Tomorrow we go to the dog track
and bet it all on Greased Lightning.

42
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,261
- You'd bet my money on a dog?
- He's a shoo-in.

43
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:50,195
Max the waiter knows the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

44
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,399
- What are you givin' me with a rabbit?
- The odds are 10 to 1.

45
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,330
- Suppose he loses.
- Why worry? This job'll last a long time.

46
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:02,007
- Suppose it doesn't.
- Jerry boy, why paint everything black?

47
00:08:02,075 --> 00:08:05,718
Suppose you got hit by a truck.
Suppose the stock market crashes.

48
00:08:06,267 --> 00:08:08,851
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

49
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,505
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

50
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,974
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

51
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:17,869
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is underwater.

52
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,570
Four,

53
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,715
three,

54
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,414
two,

55
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:35,628
one.

56
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:51,306
All right, everybody. This is a raid.

57
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm a federal agent.
You're all under arrest.

58
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:57,765
I want another cup of coffee.

59
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:10,690
All right, Spats.

60
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,381
- The services are over. Let's go.
- Go where?

61
00:09:13,451 --> 00:09:17,410
A country club for retired bootleggers.
I'm puttin' you up for membership.

62
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:20,416
- I don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

63
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:25,092
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats - striped.

64
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:28,160
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

65
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:32,125
Embalming people with coffee. 86 proof.

66
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,686
Me? I'm just a customer.

67
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:39,710
Oh, come on, Spats. We know you own
the joint. Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

68
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:43,806
- Mozarella? Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

69
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,558
From who? Toothpick Charlie maybe?

70
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,693
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

71
00:09:51,522 --> 00:09:53,757
Buttermilk.

72
00:09:54,433 --> 00:09:57,050
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

73
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:59,030
Come on. On your feet.

74
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,741
- You're wastin' the taxpayers' money.
- Call your lawyer if you wanna.

75
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:07,222
These are my lawyers. All Harvard men.

76
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:11,507
I wan' another cuppa coffee.

77
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,866
That solves one problem. Now we don't
have to worry about who to pay first.

78
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:00,523
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- The landlady will lock us out.

79
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,983
At Moe's Deli no
more knockwurst on credit.

80
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:06,831
We can't borrow from the girls -
they're on the way to jail.

81
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:09,744
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

82
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:14,347
Sam the bookie? Nothin' doin'.
You're not puttin' my overcoat on a dog.

83
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:17,448
- Jerry, I told you, it's a sure thing.
- We will freeze.

84
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,657
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

85
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:23,817
Look, stupid, he's 10-1.
Tomorrow we'll have 20 overcoats.

86
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,556
Greased Lightning.

87
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:39,106
- I oughta have my head examined.
- I thought you weren't talkin' to me.

88
00:11:39,178 --> 00:11:41,632
The bull fiddle's
dressed warmer than I am.

89
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:50,720
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

90
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:52,547
Thank you.

91
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,645
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

92
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,302
Thank you.

93
00:11:58,374 --> 00:12:02,563
I can't go on, Joe. I'm weak from hunger,
I got a fever, I got a hole in my shoe...

94
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:05,443
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

95
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:07,483
- How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

96
00:12:07,556 --> 00:12:12,191
Galloping Ghost. He's 15-1 and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

97
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,746
What do you want from me?
My head on a plate?

98
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,086
No, your bass.
If we hock that and my sax...

99
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,927
Are you crazy? We're up the creek
and you wanna hock the paddle.

100
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:24,188
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze.

101
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:26,972
- Anything today?
- Oh, it's you.

102
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,631
Well, you've got a lot of nerve.

103
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:30,612
Thank you.

104
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,916
Joe. Come back here.

105
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,121
Nellie, baby, if it's about Saturday night,
I can explain.

106
00:12:40,188 --> 00:12:43,864
What a heel. I spend $4
to get my hair marcelled,

107
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:45,786
I buy me a brand-new negligee,

108
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:48,217
I bake him a great big pizza pie.

109
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:50,770
- And where were you?
- Where were you?

110
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:52,303
- With you.
- Me?

111
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:54,068
Remember? You had this bad tooth.

112
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:56,307
It was impacted. His jaw was swoll out.

113
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:57,270
It was?

114
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,929
Oh, yeah.

115
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:02,928
- I took him for a blood transfusion.
- We have the same type blood.

116
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,900
- Type O.
- Oh?

117
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:09,770
- I'll make it up to you.
- You're makin' it up pretty good so far.

118
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:14,285
As soon as we get a job, I'll take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

119
00:13:14,357 --> 00:13:18,130
How about it? Has Poliakoff got
anything for us? We're desperate.

120
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:21,610
Well, it just so happens
he is looking for a bass.

121
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,592
And a sax.

122
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,159
Right?

123
00:13:25,523 --> 00:13:26,635
Right.

124
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,094
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

125
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:33,291
At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.
Transportation and expenses all paid.

126
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,141
Isn't she a bit of terrific?
Let's see Poliakoff.

127
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,036
- He's busy. You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

128
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,346
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

129
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:45,162
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

130
00:13:45,229 --> 00:13:48,010
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

131
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,970
Whaddaya mean, who is it?
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for ya.

132
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,702
Gladys. Are ya there?

133
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:55,876
Gladys!

134
00:13:55,947 --> 00:13:59,328
Meshugana.
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

135
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:02,304
- Now she's in bed with nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

136
00:14:02,378 --> 00:14:04,035
And Cora Jackson?

137
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:07,301
Last I heard, she was playin'
with the Salvation Army.

138
00:14:07,369 --> 00:14:09,408
Drexel 9044.

139
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,301
Those idiot broads.

140
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:15,644
Here we are, packed and ready to leave
for Miami, and what happens?

141
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:20,606
The sax runs off with a Bible salesman
and the bass gets pregnant.

142
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:22,564
Bienstock, I oughta fire you.

143
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,889
Me? I'm the manager,
not the night watchman.

144
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,377
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

145
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,266
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

146
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,665
On the level?

147
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:36,064
Bessie let her hair grow
and is playing with Stokowski.

148
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,089
- Black Bottom Bessie?
- Schpielt zich mit der Philharmonic.

149
00:14:40,673 --> 00:14:44,152
- How about Rosemary Schultz?
- Slashed her wrists when Valentino died.

150
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:47,639
We might as well do the same
if we don't find two dames by tonight.

151
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:52,151
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by 8 o'clock.

152
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,154
The moment anything turns up,
I'll give you a tinkle.

153
00:14:56,222 --> 00:14:58,872
Bye, Sig. I wonder
if I've got room for another ulcer.

154
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,395
Nellie, get me long-distance.

155
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:05,744
- Sig, we wanna talk to you.
- About the Florida job.

156
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,859
- Nellie told us about it.
- Not too late, are we?

157
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:10,548
What are ya? Comedians? Get out.

158
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,235
The William Morris Agency in New York.

159
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:16,600
- You need a bass and a sax?
- The instruments are right but you're not.

160
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:18,413
I wanna speak to Mr Morris.

161
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:21,356
- What's wrong with us?
- You're the wrong shape.

162
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:25,205
- What do you want? Hunchbacks?
- It's not the backs that worry me.

163
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,644
What kind of a band is it?

164
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:28,881
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

165
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,640
- And blond.
- We could dye our hair.

166
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,789
And you gotta be girls.

167
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:33,422
No, we couldn't.

168
00:15:33,493 --> 00:15:36,339
- Mr William Morris.
- You mean this is a girls' band?

169
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:39,699
Yeah. Good old Nellie.
I could wring her neck.

170
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,283
Let's talk this over.
Why couldn't we do it?

171
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:45,453
When we worked in the gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings.

172
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:48,817
When you booked us with
the Hawaiian band, we wore grass skirts.

173
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:52,077
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No, he ain't eatin' so good.

174
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,966
His empty stomach has gone to his head.

175
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:57,926
Joe, three weeks in Florida. We could
borrow clothes from the chorus girls.

176
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,315
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking.

177
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:03,975
We get second-hand wigs,
a little padding.

178
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,663
We call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine.

179
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:09,286
Josephine and Geraldine... Come on.

180
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:12,487
If you wanna pick up
a little money tonight,

181
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:16,484
at the University of Illinois
they're havin' a St Valentine's dance.

182
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,048
We'll take it.

183
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,905
$6 a man. Be on the campus
at Urbana at 8 o'clock.

184
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,718
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

185
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:26,949
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

186
00:16:27,018 --> 00:16:30,246
Hello. Mr Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

187
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,409
You don't have two girl musicians
available, do you?

188
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,756
A sax player and a bass?

189
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:38,942
- If William Morris doesn't come through...
- Come on, Geraldine.

190
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:43,487
It's 100 miles. It's snowin' outside.
How do we get there?

191
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,247
- I'll find something.
- Like what?

192
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,771
Don't crowd me.

193
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:51,520
- How'd it go, girls?
- I oughta wring your neck.

194
00:16:51,588 --> 00:16:53,823
Please, Jerry. That's no way to talk.

195
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,051
Nellie baby, what are you doin' tonight?

196
00:16:57,123 --> 00:17:00,318
- Tonight? Why?
- Cos I've got some plans.

197
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:04,479
- I'm not doing anything.
- Really?

198
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:08,286
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

199
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,490
Then you'll be in all evening?

200
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,250
Yes, Joe.

201
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,260
Good. Then you won't
be needing your car.

202
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:16,603
My car? Why, you...

203
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:21,692
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

204
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,682
We coulda had three weeks
in Florida, all expenses paid.

205
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:36,820
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish...

206
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,799
Knock it off, will ya?

207
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,228
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

208
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,524
All right, drop 'em, you guys.

209
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,110
- Drop what?
- We came for a car.

210
00:17:52,182 --> 00:17:54,766
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

211
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:59,497
Musicians.

212
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:01,033
Wise guys.

213
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,311
OK, let's go. Aces bet.

214
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,640
It's a '25 Hupmobile, green, coupe... sir.

215
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:08,811
- It's over here.
- Yeah, over here.

216
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:13,736
- Want some gas?
- Yeah, about 40 cents' worth, please.

217
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,038
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Yeah. Why not?

218
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:19,176
And while you're at it, fill it up.

219
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,822
All right, everybody. Hands up.

220
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:35,494
Face the wall.

221
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:39,721
You too, Toothpick.

222
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:41,696
Come on.

223
00:18:43,434 --> 00:18:45,343
Come on.

224
00:18:55,624 --> 00:18:58,492
Hey. Join us.

225
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,353
OK, boss.

226
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:26,554
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

227
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,552
- Spats, what are you doin' here?
- I just dropped in to pay my respects.

228
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:32,990
- You don't owe me nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

229
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:35,706
You recommended
my mortuary to your friends.

230
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:39,035
- I don't know what you mean.
- Now I got all those coffins on my hands.

231
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:42,778
- I hate to see 'em go to waste.
- I had nothin' to do with it.

232
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,626
Too bad, Charlie.
You woulda had three eights.

233
00:19:50,428 --> 00:19:53,045
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- No, Spats, no.

234
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,024
No, Spats. Please, no.

235
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:03,086
I think I'm gonna be sick.

236
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:10,765
All right, come on outta there.

237
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:13,292
Come on.

238
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:15,374
Come on.

239
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:19,951
- We didn't see anything. Did we?
- What? No. Not a thing.

240
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:23,849
Besides, it's none of our business
if you guys wanna bump each other off.

241
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:27,984
Say... Don't I know you two
from somewhere?

242
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:30,701
Oh, no. We're just a couple of musicians.

243
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:33,452
We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

244
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,626
There's a dance tonight.

245
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:37,801
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

246
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:42,541
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Urbana. It's about 100 miles from here...

247
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:44,517
You're not goin' nowhere.

248
00:20:46,543 --> 00:20:49,389
- We're not?
- I don't like no witnesses.

249
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:52,748
- We won't breathe a word.
- You won't breathe nothin'.

250
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,722
Not even air.

251
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:30,751
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

252
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:45,661
I think they got me.

253
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,964
- They got the bull fiddle.
- No blood?

254
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:51,610
If they catch us, there'll be blood
all over. Type O. Come on.

255
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:06,584
- Where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

256
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:11,321
It's not far enough. Those guys know us.
Every hood in Chicago will be after us.

257
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:25,870
Quick, gimme a nickel.

258
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:30,740
You're gonna call the police?

259
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,417
We'd never live to testify
against Spats Colombo.

260
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,852
We gotta get out of town.
We could grow beards.

261
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:39,251
We will get out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

262
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,928
At a time like this? They wanna blast
our heads off, and you wanna shave.

263
00:22:42,997 --> 00:22:47,218
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs...?

264
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,705
Hello. Mr Poliakoff?

265
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,292
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

266
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,322
Florida Limited leaving
on track one for Washington,

267
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,066
Charleston, Savannah,
Jacksonville and Miami.

268
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:19,042
All aboard.

269
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:28,102
What now?

270
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:31,039
How do they keep their
balance in these things?

271
00:23:31,114 --> 00:23:35,007
Must be the way the weight
is distributed. Now come on.

272
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:37,316
It is so drafty.

273
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:39,074
They must catch cold all the time.

274
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:42,176
- Quit stalling. We'll miss the train.
- I feel naked.

275
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:46,555
- I feel like everybody's starin' at me.
- With those legs? Are you crazy?

276
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,299
It's no use. We're not gonna
get away with it, Joe.

277
00:23:58,372 --> 00:24:02,113
My name is Josephine, and this was
your idea in the first place.

278
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:27,353
Look at that. Look how she moves.

279
00:24:27,421 --> 00:24:29,940
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

280
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:33,109
They must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

281
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,601
I tell ya, it's a whole different sex.

282
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:38,357
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

283
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:41,295
As soon as we're in Florida
we'll blow this whole setup.

284
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,060
You will not talk me into...

285
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,991
Extra. Extra. Seven slaughtered
in North Side garage.

286
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:49,519
Fear of bloody aftermath. Extra. Extra.

287
00:24:49,592 --> 00:24:52,940
- You talked me into it. Let's go.
- Attagirl, Geraldine.

288
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:56,719
- Rosella.
- Fiddle.

289
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,699
- Move along, Dolores.
- Trombone.

290
00:24:58,774 --> 00:25:00,846
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

291
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,922
- Here we are.
- Are you two from the Poliakoff Agency?

292
00:25:06,996 --> 00:25:09,548
- Yes. We're the new girls.
- Brand new.

293
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:13,676
This is our manager, Mr Bienstock.
And I'm Sweet Sue.

294
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,169
My name is Josephine.

295
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:18,151
I'm Daphne.

296
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:22,373
Saxophone, bass. Am I glad to see
you girls. You saved our lives.

297
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,389
Likewise, I'm sure.

298
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:26,373
Where did you girls play before?

299
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,803
Here, there and... around, and...

300
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:34,409
We spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

301
00:25:34,478 --> 00:25:36,070
All aboard.

302
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:38,147
You're in berths 7 and 7 A.

303
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,333
7 and 7 A.

304
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,160
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

305
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:43,137
Oh. The feeling's mutual.

306
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:47,014
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

307
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:50,307
Looks like Poliakoff sent
a couple of real ladies.

308
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:53,890
You'd better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

309
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,223
What are you...?

310
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:06,083
Daphne?

311
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,289
I never did like the name Geraldine.

312
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:19,008
Hi. I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

313
00:26:20,196 --> 00:26:22,105
My name is Josephine. Sax.

314
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:27,033
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- You'll be sorry.

315
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:30,520
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, I don't wear one myself.

316
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:32,959
- Don't you bulge?
- Bulge? Me?

317
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:36,188
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

318
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:39,833
- She is so inexpensive and she told...
- Come on, Daphne.

319
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:43,098
Say, do you know the one
about the girl tuba player

320
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,750
who was stranded on an island
with a one-legged jockey?

321
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:48,985
- No. How does it go?
- Cut it out, girls. No rough talk.

322
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:51,794
They went to a conservatory.

323
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,274
How about that talent, huh?

324
00:27:00,346 --> 00:27:02,800
- Like fallin' into a tub of butter.
- Watch it, Daphne.

325
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:06,931
When I was a kid, Joe, I dreamed I was
locked up overnight in a pastry shop.

326
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,943
And there was goodies all around.

327
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:13,685
Jelly rolls, mocha éclairs
and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts...

328
00:27:13,752 --> 00:27:17,012
Listen to me: No butter, no pastry.
We're on a diet.

329
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:19,314
Yeah, sure, Joe.

330
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:22,512
Not there. That's the emergency brake.

331
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:25,836
Now you've done it.

332
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:28,396
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

333
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:33,194
- You'd better go get it fixed.
- You'd better come help me.

334
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:42,568
This way, Daphne.

335
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:44,550
Now you tore the other one.

336
00:27:57,326 --> 00:27:58,754
Terribly sorry.

337
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,902
It's OK. I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

338
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:03,525
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

339
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:06,944
If they catch me once more,
they'll kick me out of the band.

340
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,724
Are you the replacement
for the bass and sax?

341
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,616
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

342
00:28:12,682 --> 00:28:15,048
This is Joe... sephine.

343
00:28:15,114 --> 00:28:16,804
Come in.

344
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:18,694
I'm Sugar Cane.

345
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:21,956
- Sugar Cane?
- I changed it from Sugar Kowalczyk.

346
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:25,372
- Polish?
- Yes. I come from this musical family.

347
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:28,349
My mother's a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

348
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:31,073
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

349
00:28:34,469 --> 00:28:36,541
I play the ukulele, and I sing, too.

350
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,152
I don't have much of a voice,
but this isn't much of a band, either.

351
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,041
I'm only with them cos I'm running away.

352
00:28:43,107 --> 00:28:46,848
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

353
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:48,987
Hey, you want some? It's bourbon.

354
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,479
I'll take a rain check.

355
00:28:53,473 --> 00:28:57,814
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
I can stop if I want to, only I don't want to.

356
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:00,189
- Especially when I'm blue.
- We understand.

357
00:29:00,256 --> 00:29:04,313
All the girls drink. But I'm the one
that gets caught. Story of my life.

358
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:06,870
I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

359
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,683
Are my seams straight?

360
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:15,511
I'll say.

361
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,703
- See you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

362
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:22,962
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

363
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,783
- Down, Daphne.
- See the shape of that liquor cabinet?

364
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,631
Forget it. One false move
and we're off the train.

365
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:31,892
Then it's the police,
the papers and the Mob in Chicago.

366
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:35,124
Boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

367
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:36,565
Look...

368
00:29:36,631 --> 00:29:39,826
No pastry, no butter - and no Sugar.

369
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,668
You tore 'em again.

370
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,753
Hey, Sheboygan. What was your last job?
Playing square dances?

371
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,858
No. Funerals.

372
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:29,705
Would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

373
00:30:29,771 --> 00:30:31,047
We'll try.

374
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:33,444
How did those holes get there?

375
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:36,195
Those?

376
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,202
I don't know.

377
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,898
Mice?

378
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:45,124
All right, girls. Let's take it from the top.
And put a little heat under it.

379
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,525
Bienstock!

380
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:51,733
Yes, Sue?

381
00:31:51,801 --> 00:31:55,956
I thought I made it clear
that I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

382
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,635
All right, girls. Who does this belong to?

383
00:32:03,702 --> 00:32:05,905
Come on, now. Speak up.

384
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:08,461
- Sugar, I warned you...
- Please, Mr Bienstock.

385
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:11,793
I've had it. In Kansas you smuggled
liquor in a shampoo bottle.

386
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,998
Before that you had
a pint in your ukelele...

387
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,693
Mr Bienstock, could I have my flask?

388
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:18,664
Sure. Pack your things.
At the next station... Your flask?

389
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:22,033
Yes. Just a little bourbon.
Must have slipped through.

390
00:32:22,994 --> 00:32:23,975
Give me that.

391
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:26,860
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

392
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:30,820
- Oh, yes. For a whole year.
- I thought you said three years.

393
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:33,099
We got time off for good behavior.

394
00:32:33,712 --> 00:32:39,461
There are two things I will not put up with
during working hours: Liquor and men.

395
00:32:40,014 --> 00:32:42,696
- Men?
- Don't worry about that.

396
00:32:42,766 --> 00:32:45,034
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

397
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:48,067
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

398
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,724
And they all just want
one thing from a girl.

399
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:54,281
I beg your pardon, miss.

400
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:57,343
All right, girls. From the top again.

401
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:36,606
- Hortense, dear, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

402
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:39,324
- Maude, sweet dreams.
- Good night, Daphne.

403
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:41,050
Good night, Gloria.

404
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,258
Dolores, you sleep tight, you hear?

405
00:33:44,863 --> 00:33:47,731
- Nighty-night, Emily.
- Toodle-oo.

406
00:33:50,142 --> 00:33:52,051
How about that "toodle-oo."

407
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:56,530
Steady, boy.
Just keep tellin' yourself you're a girl.

408
00:33:56,605 --> 00:33:58,514
- I'm a girl.
- You're a girl.

409
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:02,714
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

410
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,785
I'm a...

411
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:10,064
Get a load of that rhythm section.

412
00:34:11,578 --> 00:34:12,886
I'm a girl.

413
00:34:12,953 --> 00:34:14,894
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

414
00:34:14,968 --> 00:34:16,877
I'm a girl.

415
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:20,557
Good night, Sugar.

416
00:34:24,055 --> 00:34:25,964
Good night, honey.

417
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:30,226
Honey? Hey, she called me "honey."

418
00:34:30,293 --> 00:34:31,918
Ooh, honey.

419
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:35,151
- What are you doin'?
- Just makin' sure honey stays in her hive.

420
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:37,871
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

421
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,721
Supposin' I gotta go...
like for a drink of water or something.

422
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,208
- Fight it.
- Well, suppose I lose.

423
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:47,110
- Suppose it's an emergency.
- Pull the emergency brake.

424
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:52,198
Hey, Bienstock. You know, there's
something funny about those new girls.

425
00:34:52,272 --> 00:34:56,297
- Funny? In what way?
- I don't know, but I can feel it right here.

426
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:59,813
Having an ulcer is like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

427
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:02,602
You watch your ulcers,
I'll watch those two.

428
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:06,018
OK, everybody go to bed.
Good night, girls.

429
00:35:06,957 --> 00:35:09,738
- Good night, Daphne.
- Good night, Josephine.

430
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:20,609
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

431
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:22,339
I wish I were dead.

432
00:35:22,409 --> 00:35:24,775
I'm a girl... I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

433
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:08,890
Daphne.

434
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:20,377
Sugar.

435
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:24,054
I wanted to thank you for
covering up for me. You're a real pal.

436
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:28,281
It's nothing.

437
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:30,931
I just thought that
us girls should stick together.

438
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:33,489
If it wasn't for you,
they'd have kicked me off the train.

439
00:36:33,562 --> 00:36:36,594
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

440
00:36:37,657 --> 00:36:39,566
It's freezing outside.

441
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,770
I mean, when I think about you
and your poor ukulele...

442
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:45,332
If there's ever anything I can do for you...

443
00:36:45,398 --> 00:36:47,307
I can think of a million things.

444
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,299
That's one of 'em.

445
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:54,762
It's Sweet Sue.

446
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:08,554
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.

447
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:12,454
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.
Not even Josephine.

448
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:15,210
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

449
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,613
You stay here as long as you like.

450
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:22,637
I'm not crowding you, am I?

451
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:24,611
No. It's nice and cosy.

452
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:30,340
When I was a little girl, on cold nights
like this, I'd crawl into bed with my sister.

453
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:33,575
We'd cuddle up under the covers and
pretend we were lost in a dark cave

454
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:35,716
and were trying to find our way out.

455
00:37:36,716 --> 00:37:38,625
Very interesting.

456
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,878
- Anything wrong?
- No, no. Not a thing.

457
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,297
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

458
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,343
That's ridiculous.

459
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,782
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

460
00:37:52,872 --> 00:37:55,075
- You've got cold feet.
- Isn't that ridiculous?

461
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:57,531
Here, let me warm them up a little.

462
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:01,533
- There. Isn't that better?
- Yes. I'm a girl... I'm a girl...

463
00:38:01,606 --> 00:38:03,809
- What?
- I'm a very sick girl.

464
00:38:03,877 --> 00:38:06,429
- I'd better go before I catch something.
- Not that sick.

465
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:08,410
I've got very low resistance.

466
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:12,386
Sugar, if you feel you're
coming down with something, my dear,

467
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,450
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

468
00:38:15,522 --> 00:38:18,368
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

469
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:19,927
Don't move.

470
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:22,486
- Hold on.
- OK.

471
00:38:43,772 --> 00:38:45,681
Up. Up.

472
00:38:50,938 --> 00:38:53,141
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

473
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:56,120
- How's the bottle?
- Half-full.

474
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,507
- You'd better get some cups.
- Cups?

475
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,106
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

476
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:15,692
Put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

477
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:18,349
No lights. We don't want them to know.

478
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,721
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

479
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:24,047
Spills, thrills, laughs and games.

480
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:26,351
This may even turn out
to be a surprise party.

481
00:39:26,419 --> 00:39:28,938
- What's the surprise?
- Not yet.

482
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,824
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

483
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,580
That'll put hair on your chest.

484
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,558
No fair guessing.

485
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:38,729
Is this a private clambake?

486
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,686
It's private. Please, go away.

487
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:43,052
Dolores, do you still have that vermouth?

488
00:39:43,118 --> 00:39:44,939
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

489
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:47,754
We've got bourbon.
We can make Manhattans.

490
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:50,154
Manhattans? At this time of night?

491
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,805
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar.

492
00:39:52,876 --> 00:39:54,730
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

493
00:39:56,651 --> 00:39:59,105
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in upper 7.

494
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:02,723
- I'll get cheese and crackers.
- I'll get a shaker, you get a corkscrew.

495
00:40:02,795 --> 00:40:05,063
Hey, Rosella, there's a party in upper 7.

496
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,039
- You got a corkscrew?
- Stella has.

497
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,600
Go get some paper cups.

498
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:11,582
Hey, there's a party in upper 7.

499
00:40:16,904 --> 00:40:19,969
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

500
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:22,688
I brought some cheese and crackers.

501
00:40:22,758 --> 00:40:26,270
- Will ten cups be enough?
- This is a party for two. Ten cups?

502
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:32,062
- Please, girls. Will you stop this?
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?

503
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:36,471
Girls, you'll wake up
the neighbors downstairs.

504
00:40:36,547 --> 00:40:38,750
Watch that corkscrew.

505
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:41,916
- Here's a cracker.
- No crackers in bed.

506
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:44,407
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

507
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,299
Here's the cocktail shaker.

508
00:40:46,368 --> 00:40:49,782
- I wish we had ice.
- Easy on the vermouth.

509
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:53,651
13 girls in a berth is bad luck.
12 of you will have to get out.

510
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:57,239
- Pass me the peanut butter.
- Anyone for salami?

511
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,611
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

512
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:03,923
Hey. Have you got any
maraschino cherries on you?

513
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,394
Never mind.

514
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,512
Maraschino cherries?

515
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:24,850
What's going on here?

516
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,701
Daphne. Daphne, where are you?

517
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:31,953
It's not my fault. I didn't invite 'em.

518
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,931
Come on, girls, break it up.

519
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:38,125
You heard Josephine.
Girls. Everybody out.

520
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,678
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm going to get some ice.

521
00:41:41,844 --> 00:41:43,698
Get out.

522
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:46,480
That's right, Sugar.
Now the rest of you. Out.

523
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,633
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a Manhattan.

524
00:41:50,706 --> 00:41:54,218
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar. Don't leave me here alone.

525
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,428
Come on, kids. It's two o'clock.

526
00:41:56,497 --> 00:42:00,718
You've had your fun.
The party's over. Everybody go home.

527
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:03,947
- What's this?
- Josephine, over here before it melts.

528
00:42:10,638 --> 00:42:12,710
Put it here.

529
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,268
Sugar, you're gonna
get into a lot of trouble.

530
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:16,747
You'd better keep a lookout.

531
00:42:16,812 --> 00:42:19,233
If Bienstock catches you again...

532
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:21,313
What's the matter with you, anyway?

533
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:23,426
I'm not very bright, I guess.

534
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:25,570
I wouldn't say that. Careless, maybe.

535
00:42:25,642 --> 00:42:30,496
No, just dumb. If I had any brains, I
wouldn't be with this crummy girls' band.

536
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:32,324
Well, why'd you take this job?

537
00:42:32,392 --> 00:42:35,293
I used to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it anymore.

538
00:42:35,368 --> 00:42:37,822
Have you ever been with a male band?

539
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:39,007
Who, me?

540
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,671
That's what I'm running away from.

541
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:44,287
I worked with six in the last two years.
Oh, brother.

542
00:42:44,613 --> 00:42:46,074
- Rough?
- I'll say.

543
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:49,247
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

544
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,804
I have this thing
about saxophone players.

545
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:54,137
Especially tenor sax.

546
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:59,031
- Really?
- I don't know why, but they curdle me.

547
00:42:59,107 --> 00:43:02,684
All they have to do is play eight bars of
"Come To Me, My Melancholy Baby"

548
00:43:02,753 --> 00:43:06,396
and I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to 'em.

549
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,534
- That so?
- Every time.

550
00:43:10,336 --> 00:43:12,310
You know, I play tenor sax.

551
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:16,311
But you're a girl - thank goodness.
That's why I joined this band.

552
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:19,731
Safety first. Anything
to get away from those bums.

553
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:23,483
You don't know what they're like.
You fall for 'em.

554
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:26,843
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin.

555
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:29,209
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

556
00:43:29,276 --> 00:43:31,860
spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

557
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:33,519
You don't say.

558
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:37,046
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the sax's gone.

559
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:41,847
All that's left is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste all squeezed out.

560
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:46,221
You pull yourself together, you go on to
the next job, the next saxophone player.

561
00:43:46,296 --> 00:43:48,400
It's the same thing all over again.

562
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:51,503
You see what I mean? Not very bright.

563
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:54,349
Brains aren't everything.

564
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:58,414
I can tell you one thing. It's not
gonna happen to me again - ever.

565
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:01,419
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

566
00:44:01,493 --> 00:44:05,648
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

567
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:08,300
- How about a couple of drinks for us?
- Sure.

568
00:44:09,586 --> 00:44:12,432
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

569
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:15,148
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

570
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:17,127
- About what?
- The future.

571
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:20,364
You know - like a husband. That's why
I'm glad we're going to Florida.

572
00:44:20,433 --> 00:44:23,628
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

573
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:26,084
They all go south for the winter,
like birds.

574
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,387
- Gonna catch yourself a rich bird?
- I don't care how rich he is.

575
00:44:29,454 --> 00:44:33,446
As long as he has a yacht, a private
railroad car and his own toothpaste.

576
00:44:33,518 --> 00:44:36,746
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

577
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:40,324
With money like Rockefeller and
shoulders like Johnny Weissmuller.

578
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:43,361
- I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

579
00:44:43,435 --> 00:44:47,111
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

580
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:50,275
- Haven't you ever noticed it?
- Yeah, now that you mention.

581
00:44:50,345 --> 00:44:53,093
They get those weak eyes from reading.

582
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:57,415
Those long, tiny little columns
in The Wall Street Journal.

583
00:44:58,023 --> 00:45:00,891
That bass fiddle, she sure
knows how to throw a party.

584
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:02,876
Hot-diggety-dog.

585
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:05,947
Well, happy days.

586
00:45:06,502 --> 00:45:10,145
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

587
00:45:13,956 --> 00:45:15,995
So the one-legged jockey said...

588
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:17,856
What did he say?

589
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:23,191
So the one-legged jockey said: "Don't
worry about me, baby. I ride side-saddle."

590
00:45:30,177 --> 00:45:32,183
I'm terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

591
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:34,906
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

592
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:36,731
I think... Ow. You dropped it.

593
00:45:36,799 --> 00:45:38,391
Oh, that's cold.

594
00:45:38,463 --> 00:45:41,397
- Oh, no, please. Don't do that.
- She's ticklish.

595
00:45:45,469 --> 00:45:48,250
Help. Please. Help. Help.

596
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:49,745
Josephine.

597
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,055
Please stop that. Stop that.

598
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:05,458
- What happened?
- Search me.

599
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,438
I mean, I'll see.

600
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:19,694
All right, what's goin' on around here?

601
00:46:19,765 --> 00:46:21,520
Bienstock!

602
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,649
Are we in Florida?

603
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:09,255
Sugar?

604
00:47:09,322 --> 00:47:11,557
Here. I'll carry the instruments.

605
00:47:11,626 --> 00:47:14,178
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Thank you, Daphne.

606
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,158
Isn't she a sweetheart?

607
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:24,316
How do you do?

608
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,611
Zowie!

609
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:32,059
There they are. More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

610
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,042
I bet there isn't one under 75.

611
00:47:34,116 --> 00:47:37,376
That's three quarters of a century.
Makes a girl think.

612
00:47:37,444 --> 00:47:39,996
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

613
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,725
Yes.

614
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:52,470
Pardon me, miss.

615
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,152
- May I?
- Help yourself.

616
00:47:56,224 --> 00:47:58,711
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

617
00:47:59,423 --> 00:48:00,851
I'm Cinderella the Second.

618
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,851
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

619
00:48:06,013 --> 00:48:07,922
Me, too. Bye-bye.

620
00:48:08,541 --> 00:48:11,638
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

621
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:13,617
Aren't you a sweetheart.

622
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:21,559
It certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

623
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:23,381
Personally, I'm type O.

624
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,653
I've always been fascinated
by show business.

625
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:27,476
Is that so?

626
00:48:27,545 --> 00:48:30,577
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

627
00:48:30,648 --> 00:48:33,494
- Oh, you invest in shows?
- Showgirls.

628
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,374
- I've been married seven or eight times.
- You're not sure?

629
00:48:36,439 --> 00:48:38,348
Mama is keeping score.

630
00:48:38,422 --> 00:48:41,323
- She's getting annoyed with me.
- I wouldn't wonder.

631
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:44,843
So when George White's Scandals
opened, she packed me off to Florida.

632
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:49,650
She thinks I'm out on my yacht,
deep-sea fishing.

633
00:48:50,388 --> 00:48:54,664
Well, pull in your reel, Mr Fielding.
You're barking up the wrong fish.

634
00:48:56,147 --> 00:48:58,993
If I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner?

635
00:48:59,281 --> 00:49:02,127
- I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.
- Oh, of course.

636
00:49:02,193 --> 00:49:04,581
- Which instrument do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

637
00:49:04,656 --> 00:49:06,346
Oh, fascinating.

638
00:49:06,416 --> 00:49:09,350
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

639
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:11,495
Most of the time, I slap it.

640
00:49:12,942 --> 00:49:14,828
You must be quite a girl.

641
00:49:14,894 --> 00:49:16,780
Wanna bet?

642
00:49:16,942 --> 00:49:20,519
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.
Sort of a contortionist.

643
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:24,101
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

644
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:25,349
Zowie!

645
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,753
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

646
00:49:27,819 --> 00:49:29,728
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

647
00:49:31,914 --> 00:49:33,823
- Bye-bye, Mr Fielding.
- Bye-bye?

648
00:49:33,897 --> 00:49:37,060
- This is where I get off.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

649
00:49:37,129 --> 00:49:39,201
You don't get off that easy.

650
00:49:39,273 --> 00:49:41,727
All right, driver.
Once around the park, slowly.

651
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,709
And keep your eyes on the road.

652
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:56,217
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr Fielding?

653
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:00,323
- Oh, please. It won't happen again.
- I'll say.

654
00:50:00,388 --> 00:50:02,907
- Please, come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

655
00:50:02,979 --> 00:50:04,888
Please, miss...

656
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:09,148
Zowie!

657
00:50:09,218 --> 00:50:11,900
All right, girls. Here are
your room assignments.

658
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,784
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

659
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,589
Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.

660
00:50:17,664 --> 00:50:21,110
And, Mary Lou, do up your kimono
when you ring for room service.

661
00:50:21,183 --> 00:50:23,386
Josephine and Daphne are in 413.

662
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:26,453
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

663
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:29,044
What did you expect?
A one-legged jockey?

664
00:50:29,117 --> 00:50:30,610
Rosella and Emily in 415...

665
00:50:31,357 --> 00:50:33,876
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

666
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:38,256
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

667
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:42,737
414... That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

668
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,045
my last time around with a male band.

669
00:50:45,113 --> 00:50:46,738
What a heel he was.

670
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:50,419
- A saxophone player?
- What else? Was I ever crazy about him.

671
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:53,454
At two in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

672
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:56,112
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

673
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:59,924
- So he threw it right in my face.
- Forget saxophone players.

674
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,509
You're gonna meet
a millionaire - a young one.

675
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:05,777
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

676
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:15,816
Oh. Are these your bags?

677
00:51:17,106 --> 00:51:21,033
- And that one, too.
- OK, doll.

678
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:24,334
- I suppose you want a tip.
- Forget it, doll.

679
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:29,484
After all, you work here and I work here.
It's nice to have you with the organization.

680
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:31,591
- Bye-bye.
- Listen, doll.

681
00:51:31,663 --> 00:51:34,662
- What time do you get off tonight?
- Why?

682
00:51:34,734 --> 00:51:37,831
I'm workin' the night shift and
I got a bottle of gin stashed away.

683
00:51:37,901 --> 00:51:41,315
- When there's a lull...
- Aren't you a little young for that, sonny?

684
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:45,032
Oh, you wanna see my driver's license?

685
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:50,313
- Get lost, will you?
- That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.

686
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,638
Oh, and... get rid of your roommate.

687
00:52:08,387 --> 00:52:10,012
- Dirty old man.
- What happened?

688
00:52:10,082 --> 00:52:13,376
- I got pinched in the elevator.
- See how the other half lives?

689
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:14,750
I'm not even pretty.

690
00:52:14,818 --> 00:52:18,875
They don't care. You're wearing a skirt.
It's like waving a red flag to a bull.

691
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:22,293
I'm sick of being the flag.
I wanna be a bull again.

692
00:52:22,368 --> 00:52:23,928
- Let's blow.
- Blow where?

693
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,163
You promised me that the minute
we hit Florida we'd beat it.

694
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:31,452
- How can we? We're broke.
- We can find another band. A male band.

695
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:36,219
Spats Colombo is looking for us
in every male band in the country.

696
00:52:36,285 --> 00:52:39,415
- It's humiliating.
- So you got pinched. So what?

697
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:41,938
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

698
00:52:42,011 --> 00:52:44,149
But how long can we keep this up?

699
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:46,585
What's the beef? We're sittin' pretty.

700
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,129
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week. Look.

701
00:52:50,202 --> 00:52:52,689
Look at the palm trees, flying fish...

702
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:54,866
What are you givin' me with flyin' fish?

703
00:52:54,936 --> 00:52:57,269
I know why you wanna stay.
You're after Sugar.

704
00:52:57,336 --> 00:53:00,204
- Me, after Sugar?
- I saw the both of you in that bus.

705
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,207
All lovey-dovey and whisperin'
and borrowin' each other's lipstick.

706
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:06,667
- What are you saying? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

707
00:53:06,742 --> 00:53:10,385
- We're just like sisters.
- Well, I'm your fairy godmother.

708
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,362
And I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

709
00:53:13,748 --> 00:53:15,657
Are you decent?

710
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:22,600
Come in.

711
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:26,184
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

712
00:53:26,257 --> 00:53:28,078
It has all my resort clothes.

713
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:30,540
- No, we haven't.
- I can't understand it.

714
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:33,258
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

715
00:53:33,328 --> 00:53:35,214
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

716
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,818
- There must be a sneak thief round here.
- Oh. Here it is. Hi, Sug.

717
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:43,530
- We're going for a swim. Coming?
- A swim. Oh, you betcha.

718
00:53:43,598 --> 00:53:46,248
You haven't got a bathing suit.

719
00:53:46,317 --> 00:53:47,843
I don't have one either.

720
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:51,876
- She doesn't have one either. You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

721
00:53:51,948 --> 00:53:55,460
- How about you, Josephine?
- I think I'll soak in a hot tub.

722
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:59,720
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak. Come on.

723
00:53:59,786 --> 00:54:03,014
- Don't get burned, Daphne.
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.

724
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:07,749
See? She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
we'll rub it on each other. Bye-bye.

725
00:55:07,707 --> 00:55:11,415
Daphne. Cut it out.
What do you think you're doing?

726
00:55:11,482 --> 00:55:14,448
Just a little trick
I picked up in the elevator.

727
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,593
Ooh, look out. Here comes a big one.

728
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,584
Daphne. I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

729
00:55:49,649 --> 00:55:52,233
You should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

730
00:55:52,304 --> 00:55:54,572
I mean your shoulders and your arms.

731
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,778
It's carrying that bull fiddle around.

732
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:59,017
- There's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

733
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:01,191
You're so flat-chested.

734
00:56:01,263 --> 00:56:04,262
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

735
00:56:04,334 --> 00:56:06,275
Watch out, Daphne.

736
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:08,715
Sugar, come on. Let's play ball.

737
00:56:10,188 --> 00:56:11,681
Junior, time for your nap.

738
00:56:11,756 --> 00:56:14,177
No. I wanna play.

739
00:56:14,252 --> 00:56:16,455
You heard your mother, Junior. Scram!

740
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:19,140
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us.

741
00:56:19,211 --> 00:56:21,632
Mommy!

742
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:22,883
Here we go.

743
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:26,248
I like coffee, I like tea.

744
00:56:26,313 --> 00:56:29,857
How many boys are stuck on me?

745
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,894
One, two, three,

746
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,261
four, five, six, seven...

747
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,480
I'm terribly sorry.
You're not hurt, are you?

748
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:47,101
- I don't think so.
- I wish you'd make sure.

749
00:56:47,172 --> 00:56:49,058
Because when people find out who I am,

750
00:56:49,123 --> 00:56:54,107
they hire a shyster lawyer and sue me
for three quarters of a million dollars.

751
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:57,210
- I won't sue you, no matter who you are.
- Thank you.

752
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:02,236
- Who are you?
- Now, really!

753
00:57:03,872 --> 00:57:05,846
Sugar!

754
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,512
Come on.

755
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:08,860
Honestly.

756
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:11,831
Cheerio.

757
00:57:16,702 --> 00:57:19,636
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

758
00:57:19,709 --> 00:57:22,359
- Are you staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

759
00:57:22,428 --> 00:57:24,053
Your face is familiar.

760
00:57:24,124 --> 00:57:27,058
You may have seen it
in newspapers or magazines.

761
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:29,040
- Vanity Fair.
- That must be it.

762
00:57:29,883 --> 00:57:33,198
Would you mind moving a little?
You're blocking my view.

763
00:57:33,273 --> 00:57:34,450
Of what?

764
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:38,350
They run up a red-and-white flag
on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.

765
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:40,333
You own a yacht?

766
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:43,408
Which one is it? The big one?

767
00:57:44,024 --> 00:57:44,885
Certainly not.

768
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:48,659
With all the world unrest, nobody should
have a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

769
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,571
I quite agree.

770
00:57:51,638 --> 00:57:53,742
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

771
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:55,852
- Your wife?
- No, my flag steward.

772
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:59,090
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

773
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,804
No, my cocktail steward.

774
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:04,362
If you're interested in
whether I am married or not...

775
00:58:04,531 --> 00:58:07,148
- Oh, I'm not interested at all.
- Well, I'm not.

776
00:58:07,794 --> 00:58:09,866
That's very interesting.

777
00:58:13,233 --> 00:58:15,621
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

778
00:58:15,697 --> 00:58:18,314
I'll bet while we were talking,
you made $100,000?

779
00:58:18,383 --> 00:58:20,389
Could be. You play the market?

780
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:23,723
- No, the ukulele. And I sing, too.
- For your own amusement?

781
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,676
We are appearing at the hotel.

782
00:58:25,742 --> 00:58:27,880
Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators.

783
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,324
- You're society girls.
- Oh, yes, quite. Bryn Mawr, Vassar...

784
00:58:32,397 --> 00:58:34,338
We're just doing this for a lark.

785
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,917
Syncopators. Does that mean you play
that very fast music... jazz?

786
00:58:38,988 --> 00:58:40,897
Yeah. Real hot.

787
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:45,987
I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

788
00:58:46,058 --> 00:58:46,985
I do, too.

789
00:58:47,049 --> 00:58:51,804
As a matter of fact, I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

790
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,708
Good school. Your family
doesn't object to your career?

791
00:58:56,008 --> 00:58:58,974
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

792
00:58:59,046 --> 00:59:00,932
But I don't care. It was such a bore.

793
00:59:00,998 --> 00:59:03,266
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

794
00:59:03,334 --> 00:59:05,340
- Opening at the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

795
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:07,322
And always the same 400.

796
00:59:08,292 --> 00:59:10,974
It's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

797
00:59:11,044 --> 00:59:13,912
I'd have remembered
anybody as attractive as you.

798
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:17,946
You're very kind. I'll bet
you're also gentle and helpless.

799
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:19,162
I beg your pardon?

800
00:59:19,234 --> 00:59:21,688
You see, I have a theory
about men who wear glasses.

801
00:59:21,762 --> 00:59:24,957
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I know you better.

802
00:59:25,025 --> 00:59:27,773
- What are you doing tonight?
- Tonight?

803
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,588
Maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

804
00:59:30,656 --> 00:59:33,851
- I'd like to, but that would be difficult.
- Why?

805
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:37,049
I only come ashore twice a day
when the tide goes out.

806
00:59:37,214 --> 00:59:40,082
It's on account of these shells.
That's my hobby.

807
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:42,972
- You collect shells?
- So did my father and grandfather.

808
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,491
You might say we had
a passion for shells.

809
00:59:45,564 --> 00:59:47,930
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

810
00:59:49,404 --> 00:59:53,778
- Shell Oil?
- Please, no names. Just call me Junior.

811
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:56,239
Sugar!

812
00:59:56,314 --> 00:59:57,742
Time to change for dinner.

813
00:59:57,817 --> 01:00:00,631
Run along, Daphne dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

814
01:00:11,254 --> 01:00:13,555
What, young lady?
What are you staring at?

815
01:00:13,622 --> 01:00:15,377
Happens to me all the time.

816
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,510
I recognized him, too.
His picture was in Vanity Fair.

817
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,995
- Would you move along, please?
- Yes. You're in his way.

818
01:00:22,068 --> 01:00:24,489
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

819
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:26,352
His yacht?

820
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:30,062
It sleeps 12. This is my friend Daphne.
She's a Vassar girl.

821
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:31,754
I'm a what?

822
01:00:31,826 --> 01:00:33,735
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

823
01:00:35,377 --> 01:00:38,671
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

824
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:40,328
She squealed on her roommate

825
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,530
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

826
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,649
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate. Hm?

827
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:50,406
Well, I think I'd better be going.

828
01:00:50,478 --> 01:00:52,965
It was delightful meeting you both.

829
01:00:53,037 --> 01:00:55,785
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

830
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:58,371
Do come. It'll be such fun.

831
01:00:58,444 --> 01:01:00,865
- And bring your yacht.
- Come on, Daphne.

832
01:01:06,986 --> 01:01:11,043
- How about that guy?!
- Hands off. I saw him first.

833
01:01:11,113 --> 01:01:16,065
Sugar, a little advice. If I were a girl,
and I am, I'd watch my step.

834
01:01:16,136 --> 01:01:18,688
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

835
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:22,620
- I can't wait to tell Josephine.
- Yeah, Josephine...

836
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:25,278
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

837
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,836
Neither can I.
Let's go tell her right now.

838
01:01:27,909 --> 01:01:30,047
- We don't have to run.
- Oh yes, we do.

839
01:01:38,723 --> 01:01:40,632
Josephine. Yoo-hoo.

840
01:01:41,538 --> 01:01:44,220
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny. Josie!

841
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:46,110
I can't imagine where she'd be.

842
01:01:46,177 --> 01:01:48,118
- I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

843
01:01:48,192 --> 01:01:50,296
I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

844
01:01:50,368 --> 01:01:54,709
- Believe it or not, Josephine predicted it.
- Yes. This is one for Ripley.

845
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:57,270
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping. That's it.

846
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:01,912
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

847
01:02:14,842 --> 01:02:18,136
- Josephine.
- Oh. I didn't hear you come in.

848
01:02:24,696 --> 01:02:29,070
- Have a good time, girls?
- The most wonderful thing happened.

849
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:30,800
- What?
- Guess.

850
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:35,147
- They repealed Prohibition?
- Oh, you can do better than that.

851
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:37,804
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

852
01:02:37,877 --> 01:02:42,066
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
glasses and a yacht.

853
01:02:42,132 --> 01:02:43,244
You don't say.

854
01:02:43,316 --> 01:02:45,388
He's not only got a yacht.
He's got a bicycle.

855
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:47,305
Daphne.

856
01:02:47,379 --> 01:02:49,614
Go on. Tell me all about him.

857
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,682
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

858
01:02:52,754 --> 01:02:57,193
He's a real gentleman.
You know. Not one of these grabbers.

859
01:02:57,265 --> 01:02:59,784
Maybe you'd better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

860
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:03,717
I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute. He collects shells.

861
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:06,212
Shells? Whatever for?

862
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:08,388
Oh, you know. The old shell game?

863
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,142
Daphne, you're bothering us.

864
01:03:11,373 --> 01:03:13,794
- Anyway, you're gonna meet him tonight.
- I am?

865
01:03:13,869 --> 01:03:16,104
He said he'd come
to hear us play - maybe.

866
01:03:16,461 --> 01:03:20,802
What do you mean, maybe? I saw how
he looked at you. He'll be there for sure.

867
01:03:20,875 --> 01:03:21,768
I hope so.

868
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:25,696
What do you think, Josephine?
What does your crystal ball say?

869
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,706
Sugar. Is Sugar in here?

870
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:33,409
Sugar, you got the key? I'm locked out
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

871
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,334
See you on the bandstand, girls.

872
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:42,852
What are you tryin' to do to that girl,
puttin' on a millionaire act?

873
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:47,140
And that phony accent?
Nobody talks like that.

874
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,115
I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

875
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:52,635
This is without doubt
the trickiest, lowest, meanest...

876
01:03:58,691 --> 01:04:01,243
I'm not afraid of you.

877
01:04:02,946 --> 01:04:04,439
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

878
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:07,676
You're gonna get hurt.
When I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

879
01:04:08,481 --> 01:04:12,702
Joe. Don't look at me like that.
It was all a joke. I didn't mean any harm.

880
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,377
I'm gonna press
the suit myself. Telephone.

881
01:04:16,447 --> 01:04:18,356
Answer the tele... phone.

882
01:04:22,782 --> 01:04:24,537
Hello?

883
01:04:25,565 --> 01:04:27,474
Yes, this is 413.

884
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:31,192
Ship to shore? All right, I'll take it.

885
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,907
Daphne? It's that naughty boy again.

886
01:04:33,979 --> 01:04:36,214
You know - Osgood? In the elevator?

887
01:04:36,283 --> 01:04:38,192
You slapped my face?

888
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,769
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

889
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:45,044
Daphne can't talk right now. Is it urgent?

890
01:04:45,113 --> 01:04:47,479
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

891
01:04:47,544 --> 01:04:51,950
Tell her I'd like her to have supper with
me on my yacht after the show tonight.

892
01:04:52,215 --> 01:04:55,378
Got it. Supper, yacht,
after the show. I'll tell her.

893
01:04:55,446 --> 01:04:59,056
- Your yacht?
- The New Caledonia. That's its name.

894
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:03,499
The Old Caledonia went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

895
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:08,655
But tell her not to worry. This'll be a quiet
little midnight snack, just the two of us.

896
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:13,201
Just the two of you?
What about the crew?

897
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:16,938
That's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

898
01:05:17,617 --> 01:05:19,820
We'll have cold pheasant
with champagne.

899
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:23,630
I've checked with the coastguard.
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

900
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:28,167
And tell her I've got
a new batch of Rudy Vallee records.

901
01:05:30,063 --> 01:05:33,258
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

902
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:35,234
Pushover for who? What...

903
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:37,991
Yes, Mr Fielding.

904
01:05:38,061 --> 01:05:41,802
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat. Goodbye.

905
01:05:41,868 --> 01:05:44,355
What's that you said?

906
01:05:44,428 --> 01:05:47,972
- "Zowie." I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

907
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:52,231
You got it made. Fielding wants to have
cold pheasant with you on his yacht.

908
01:05:52,298 --> 01:05:55,810
Just the three of you on that
great big boat. You, him and Rudy Vallee.

909
01:05:55,881 --> 01:05:58,149
Fat chance. Call him back
and say I'm not goin'.

910
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,940
Of course you're not.

911
01:06:00,008 --> 01:06:01,917
I'm going.

912
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:05,342
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

913
01:06:05,414 --> 01:06:07,966
I'm gonna be on the boat with Sugar.

914
01:06:08,038 --> 01:06:10,655
- Where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

915
01:06:10,725 --> 01:06:12,218
- With me?
- That's right.

916
01:06:12,293 --> 01:06:15,325
Oh, no. Not tonight, Josephine.

917
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:30,537
Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

918
01:07:31,316 --> 01:07:33,202
You can both go take a flyin' jump.

919
01:07:33,267 --> 01:07:36,135
Remember, he's your date
for tonight, so smile.

920
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:42,760
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

921
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,118
Why do I let you talk me
into these things? Why?

922
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,906
Because we're pals. The two musketeers.

923
01:07:56,974 --> 01:08:00,650
Don't give me the musketeers.
How am I gonna keep him ashore?

924
01:08:00,717 --> 01:08:03,531
Tell him you get seasick.
Play miniature golf with him.

925
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:07,751
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

926
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:14,725
Hi. Which of you dolls is Daphne?

927
01:08:14,794 --> 01:08:16,386
Bull fiddle.

928
01:08:16,457 --> 01:08:18,692
From satchel mouth at table seven.

929
01:08:23,655 --> 01:08:27,199
- This is from me to you, doll.
- Beat it, buster.

930
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:30,270
Never mind leaving your door open.
I got a passkey.

931
01:08:36,421 --> 01:08:40,795
- What are you doin' with my flowers?
- Borrowing 'em. You'll get 'em back.

932
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,826
I guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to one.

933
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:15,281
- Do you suppose he forgot?
- You know how those millionaires are.

934
01:09:15,356 --> 01:09:17,242
These came for you.

935
01:09:17,307 --> 01:09:19,161
For me?

936
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:21,971
It's Shell Oil.

937
01:09:22,043 --> 01:09:24,278
- No!
- Yes!

938
01:09:24,346 --> 01:09:26,647
He wants to have supper
with me on his yacht.

939
01:09:26,713 --> 01:09:28,141
He's picking me up at the pier.

940
01:09:28,216 --> 01:09:29,873
- No!
- Yes.

941
01:09:29,944 --> 01:09:31,285
You heard her - yes.

942
01:09:31,352 --> 01:09:36,107
Josephine, just imagine. Me,
Sugar Kowalczyk from Sandusky, Ohio,

943
01:09:36,183 --> 01:09:37,971
on a millionaire's yacht.

944
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:40,721
If my mother could only see me now.

945
01:09:42,998 --> 01:09:45,201
I hope my mother never finds out.

946
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:49,809
That's it for tonight.
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

947
01:09:49,876 --> 01:09:55,373
reminding all you daddies out there
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso.

948
01:09:55,442 --> 01:09:57,351
And I intend to keep it that way.

949
01:10:03,889 --> 01:10:05,798
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

950
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:34,970
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

951
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,271
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

952
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,641
There's a roadhouse down the coast...

953
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:46,744
Well, I'll be... He does have a bicycle.

954
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:48,631
Who?

955
01:11:48,697 --> 01:11:50,867
About the roadhouse?

956
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:52,976
They have a Cuban band
that's the berries.

957
01:11:53,048 --> 01:11:57,007
Let's go there, blindfold the orchestra
and tango till dawn.

958
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,085
- You know something, Mr Fielding?
- What?

959
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:01,100
You're dynamite.

960
01:12:01,174 --> 01:12:04,206
You're a pretty hot
little firecracker yourself.

961
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:56,351
Ahoy, there.

962
01:12:57,449 --> 01:12:59,041
Ahoy.

963
01:13:07,495 --> 01:13:09,665
- Been waiting long?
- It's not how long you wait.

964
01:13:09,735 --> 01:13:13,476
- It's who you're waiting for.
- Thank you. And for the flowers.

965
01:13:13,542 --> 01:13:18,526
I wanted them to fly orchids from our
greenhouse, but Long Island is fogged in.

966
01:13:18,597 --> 01:13:20,603
It's the thought that counts.

967
01:13:27,459 --> 01:13:29,247
I seem to be out of gas.

968
01:13:29,315 --> 01:13:33,208
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everything.

969
01:13:33,282 --> 01:13:35,191
Oops. There.

970
01:13:40,288 --> 01:13:42,392
It seems to be stuck in reverse.

971
01:13:43,839 --> 01:13:47,099
I just got this motorboat.
It's an experimental model.

972
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:49,075
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

973
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,084
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

974
01:13:52,157 --> 01:13:55,091
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

975
01:14:20,727 --> 01:14:22,865
It looked so small from the beach.

976
01:14:22,934 --> 01:14:25,682
But when you're on it, it's like
a cruiser or a destroyer.

977
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:30,636
It's just regulation-size. We have three.
Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

978
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:33,707
Daddy's is in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

979
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:37,772
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

980
01:14:37,843 --> 01:14:39,882
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

981
01:14:39,954 --> 01:14:42,702
That depends on
whether you're coming or going.

982
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:46,892
I mean, normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

983
01:14:46,961 --> 01:14:51,432
And that's the bridge. So that you can get
from one side of the boat to the other.

984
01:14:51,504 --> 01:14:54,950
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it. Which way?

985
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:01,960
- You have an upstairs and a downstairs.
- Yes, the hurricane cellar.

986
01:15:03,693 --> 01:15:07,750
And another nice thing about
this yacht - lots of closet space.

987
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:11,267
Now, let me see. Where do you
suppose the steward set it up?

988
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:16,544
In here.

989
01:15:17,898 --> 01:15:19,523
Of course. How silly of me.

990
01:15:19,593 --> 01:15:22,788
On Thursdays they always
serve me in the small salon.

991
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:34,403
It's exquisite. Like a floating mansion.

992
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:36,379
It's all right for a bachelor.

993
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:40,831
- What a beautiful fish.
- I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

994
01:15:41,668 --> 01:15:43,838
What is it?

995
01:15:43,908 --> 01:15:46,046
It's a member of the herring family.

996
01:15:47,235 --> 01:15:49,209
A herring?

997
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:53,918
Isn't it amazing how they get those
big fish into those little glass jars?

998
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,154
They shrink when they're marinated.

999
01:15:56,225 --> 01:15:58,134
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

1000
01:15:58,209 --> 01:16:00,859
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

1001
01:16:00,928 --> 01:16:02,782
Bon voyage.

1002
01:16:06,847 --> 01:16:09,497
- Look at all that silverware.
- Trophies.

1003
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:12,980
You know. Skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

1004
01:16:13,053 --> 01:16:14,962
Isn't water polo terribly dangerous?

1005
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,938
I'll say. I had two ponies
drowned under me.

1006
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:19,898
Where's your shell collection?

1007
01:16:19,964 --> 01:16:22,265
Yes, of course.
Where could they have put it?

1008
01:16:22,331 --> 01:16:24,785
You see, on Thursdays
I'm sort of lost around here.

1009
01:16:24,859 --> 01:16:27,924
- What's on Thursdays?
- It's the crew's night off.

1010
01:16:27,994 --> 01:16:31,440
- You mean we're alone on the boat?
- Completely.

1011
01:16:31,514 --> 01:16:34,862
I've never been completely alone
with a man in the middle of the night,

1012
01:16:34,937 --> 01:16:37,587
- in the middle of the ocean.
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.

1013
01:16:37,656 --> 01:16:40,306
We're anchored.
The ship's in shipshape shape.

1014
01:16:40,375 --> 01:16:43,276
The coastguard will call
if any icebergs appear.

1015
01:16:43,735 --> 01:16:45,011
It's not the icebergs.

1016
01:16:45,078 --> 01:16:48,426
But certain men would try to
take advantage of a situation like this.

1017
01:16:48,501 --> 01:16:52,329
- You're flattering me.
- Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

1018
01:16:53,012 --> 01:16:56,688
It's not that. It's just that I'm harmless.

1019
01:16:56,756 --> 01:16:59,340
- Harmless? How?
- I don't know how to put it,

1020
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:01,352
but I've got this thing about girls.

1021
01:17:01,682 --> 01:17:05,325
- What thing?
- They just sort of leave me cold.

1022
01:17:05,394 --> 01:17:07,498
You mean, like, frigid?

1023
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,957
Well, it's more like a mental block.

1024
01:17:10,033 --> 01:17:13,163
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

1025
01:17:13,232 --> 01:17:17,387
- Have you tried?
- Have I. I'm trying all the time.

1026
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:25,859
See? Nothing.

1027
01:17:26,701 --> 01:17:29,318
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

1028
01:17:29,388 --> 01:17:32,485
- That makes me feel just awful.
- My dear, it's not your fault.

1029
01:17:32,555 --> 01:17:35,401
Now and then Mother Nature
throws somebody a dirty curve.

1030
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:37,702
Something goes wrong inside.

1031
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,486
- You mean you can't fall in love?
- Not anymore.

1032
01:17:40,554 --> 01:17:43,368
I was in love once,
but I'd rather not talk about it.

1033
01:17:43,433 --> 01:17:46,563
- Would you like a little cold pheasant?
- What happened?

1034
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:49,763
- I don't want to bore you.
- You couldn't possibly.

1035
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:51,805
Well...

1036
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,268
It was my freshman year at Princeton.

1037
01:17:54,343 --> 01:17:56,349
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

1038
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,007
Her father was
the vice president of Hupmobile.

1039
01:17:59,077 --> 01:18:00,986
She wore glasses, too.

1040
01:18:01,829 --> 01:18:04,195
That summer we were
at the Grand Canyon.

1041
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:07,042
We were on the highest ledge
watching the sunset,

1042
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:09,562
when suddenly we got
this impulse to kiss.

1043
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:12,983
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

1044
01:18:13,059 --> 01:18:14,619
I took a step toward her.

1045
01:18:15,074 --> 01:18:16,983
She took a step toward me.

1046
01:18:18,562 --> 01:18:22,619
Yes. Eight hours later
they brought her up by mule.

1047
01:18:22,689 --> 01:18:26,484
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood - type O.

1048
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,468
But it was too late.

1049
01:18:29,247 --> 01:18:31,253
Talk about sad.

1050
01:18:31,487 --> 01:18:33,428
Ever since then,

1051
01:18:33,502 --> 01:18:36,883
numb, no feelings, like my heart
was shot full of Novocain.

1052
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,251
You poor, poor boy.

1053
01:18:39,325 --> 01:18:42,139
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

1054
01:18:42,204 --> 01:18:43,959
Mint sauce or cranberries?

1055
01:18:44,635 --> 01:18:47,950
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

1056
01:18:48,026 --> 01:18:49,651
What else is there for me?

1057
01:18:49,723 --> 01:18:53,104
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everything they could.

1058
01:18:53,177 --> 01:18:55,958
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

1059
01:18:56,025 --> 01:18:59,188
Got a special tutor to read me
books that were banned in Boston.

1060
01:18:59,256 --> 01:19:01,295
Imported a troupe of Balinese dancers

1061
01:19:01,367 --> 01:19:04,846
with those bells on their ankles
and long fingernails.

1062
01:19:04,919 --> 01:19:06,828
What a waste of money.

1063
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:09,548
Have you ever tried American girls?

1064
01:19:09,622 --> 01:19:11,214
Why?

1065
01:19:16,788 --> 01:19:18,697
Was that anything?

1066
01:19:20,084 --> 01:19:21,993
Thanks just the same.

1067
01:19:22,547 --> 01:19:24,685
You should see a doctor - a good doctor.

1068
01:19:24,754 --> 01:19:29,706
I have. I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

1069
01:19:30,513 --> 01:19:35,214
Then there were the Mayo brothers,
injections, hypnosis, mineral baths.

1070
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,515
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

1071
01:19:38,767 --> 01:19:41,133
Don't say that.

1072
01:19:41,199 --> 01:19:43,500
There must be some girl
someplace that could...

1073
01:19:43,566 --> 01:19:48,747
If I ever found a girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

1074
01:19:48,813 --> 01:19:51,529
- Would you do me a favor?
- Certainly. What is it?

1075
01:19:51,597 --> 01:19:55,174
I may not be Dr Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

1076
01:19:55,244 --> 01:19:58,112
but could I take another crack at it?

1077
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,517
All right, if you insist.

1078
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:16,507
- Anything this time?
- I'm afraid not.

1079
01:20:17,798 --> 01:20:21,092
- Terribly sorry.
- Would you like some more champagne?

1080
01:20:23,493 --> 01:20:27,103
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

1081
01:20:28,068 --> 01:20:31,580
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

1082
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:33,952
I think the light switch is over there.

1083
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:41,400
That's the radio.

1084
01:20:41,473 --> 01:20:44,985
It's like taking someone
to a concert when he's tone-deaf.

1085
01:21:19,545 --> 01:21:22,129
You're not giving yourself a chance.

1086
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,109
Don't fight it.

1087
01:21:25,431 --> 01:21:27,885
Relax.

1088
01:21:40,372 --> 01:21:42,444
It's like smoking without inhaling.

1089
01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:44,424
So inhale.

1090
01:22:06,638 --> 01:22:07,914
Daphne,

1091
01:22:07,982 --> 01:22:10,217
- you're leading again.
- Sorry.

1092
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:25,698
Well?

1093
01:22:27,146 --> 01:22:29,250
I'm not quite sure.

1094
01:22:29,321 --> 01:22:31,230
Would you try it again?

1095
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:43,773
I got a funny sensation in my toes.

1096
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:48,318
Like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

1097
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:51,838
Let's throw another log on the fire.

1098
01:23:01,442 --> 01:23:03,448
I think you're on the right track.

1099
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:08,313
I must be. Your glasses
are beginning to steam up.

1100
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:33,713
I never knew it could be like this.

1101
01:23:35,514 --> 01:23:37,423
Thank you.

1102
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:40,879
They told me I was kaput,
finished, all washed up.

1103
01:23:40,952 --> 01:23:44,398
And here you are, making a chump
out of all those experts.

1104
01:23:46,839 --> 01:23:49,391
Mineral baths. Now, really.

1105
01:23:49,463 --> 01:23:51,666
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

1106
01:23:52,566 --> 01:23:54,867
I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

1107
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:09,927
Tomorrow, remind me to send
a check for $100,000 to the Milk Fund.

1108
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:14,364
Whoops.

1109
01:25:40,829 --> 01:25:43,446
- Good night.
- Good morning.

1110
01:25:43,517 --> 01:25:45,655
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

1111
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,178
$850,000.

1112
01:25:48,252 --> 01:25:50,161
Let's make it an even million.

1113
01:26:10,934 --> 01:26:12,843
I forgot to give you a receipt.

1114
01:26:52,686 --> 01:26:54,824
Hi, Jerry. Everything under control?

1115
01:26:54,893 --> 01:26:56,802
Have I got things to tell you.

1116
01:26:57,996 --> 01:27:01,256
- What happened?
- I'm engaged.

1117
01:27:01,324 --> 01:27:03,908
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

1118
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:06,246
I am.

1119
01:27:10,601 --> 01:27:12,193
What?

1120
01:27:12,265 --> 01:27:15,493
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

1121
01:27:18,152 --> 01:27:20,802
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

1122
01:27:22,183 --> 01:27:25,378
- Do you think he's too old for me?
- Jerry, you can't be serious.

1123
01:27:25,446 --> 01:27:28,162
Why not? He keeps
marryin' girls all the time.

1124
01:27:29,478 --> 01:27:31,648
But... you're not a girl. You're a guy.

1125
01:27:31,685 --> 01:27:33,571
And why would a guy
wanna marry a guy?

1126
01:27:33,636 --> 01:27:35,391
Security.

1127
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,063
- Jerry, lie down. You're not well.
- Stop treatin' me like a child.

1128
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:43,065
- I'm not stupid. I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

1129
01:27:43,138 --> 01:27:47,643
His mother. We need her approval. But
I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

1130
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,010
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

1131
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:57,821
- Like your honeymoon.
- We've been discussing that.

1132
01:27:57,887 --> 01:28:02,042
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kinda lean towards Niagara Falls.

1133
01:28:05,597 --> 01:28:08,662
Jerry, you're outta your mind.
You can't get away with this.

1134
01:28:08,732 --> 01:28:12,276
I don't expect it to last.
I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.

1135
01:28:12,348 --> 01:28:15,216
- Like when?
- Like right after the ceremony.

1136
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,639
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me

1137
01:28:18,714 --> 01:28:21,877
and I keep gettin' those
alimony checks every month.

1138
01:28:26,072 --> 01:28:27,958
Jerry, listen to me.

1139
01:28:28,024 --> 01:28:31,797
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not been done.

1140
01:28:31,864 --> 01:28:35,179
Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

1141
01:28:35,254 --> 01:28:39,027
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

1142
01:28:39,093 --> 01:28:41,514
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

1143
01:28:42,996 --> 01:28:45,231
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

1144
01:28:45,908 --> 01:28:49,354
I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I'm a...

1145
01:28:49,427 --> 01:28:53,222
I wish I were dead.
I'm a boy. Boy, oh boy, am I a boy.

1146
01:28:53,298 --> 01:28:55,566
What about my engagement present?

1147
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:58,928
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

1148
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:02,246
Hey, these are real diamonds.

1149
01:29:02,321 --> 01:29:05,102
Of course they're real.
You think my fiancé is a bum?

1150
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:09,421
- I guess I'll have to give it back to him.
- Wait a minute, Jerry. Let's not be hasty.

1151
01:29:09,487 --> 01:29:12,486
After all, we don't wanna
hurt Osgood's feelings.

1152
01:29:15,853 --> 01:29:18,503
- Just a minute.
- It's me. Sugar.

1153
01:29:26,835 --> 01:29:28,361
Come in.

1154
01:29:28,434 --> 01:29:32,524
I thought I heard voices. I had to talk to
somebody. I don't feel like going to sleep.

1155
01:29:32,594 --> 01:29:36,749
- What you need is a slug of bourbon.
- Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

1156
01:29:36,816 --> 01:29:39,051
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

1157
01:29:40,272 --> 01:29:43,173
It was suicidally beautiful.

1158
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:44,294
Did he get fresh?

1159
01:29:44,367 --> 01:29:47,748
Of course not. As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

1160
01:29:47,822 --> 01:29:50,341
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

1161
01:29:50,413 --> 01:29:53,227
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

1162
01:29:53,293 --> 01:29:56,456
Candlelight, mint sauce and cranberries.

1163
01:29:56,844 --> 01:29:58,730
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

1164
01:29:59,243 --> 01:30:01,925
I'm going to see him again
tonight - and every night.

1165
01:30:01,995 --> 01:30:03,271
I think he's going to propose.

1166
01:30:03,338 --> 01:30:06,272
- As soon as he gets up his nerve.
- That's some nerve.

1167
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:08,487
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

1168
01:30:09,385 --> 01:30:11,523
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

1169
01:30:11,593 --> 01:30:13,414
That's wonderful.

1170
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,715
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

1171
01:30:15,784 --> 01:30:17,507
Well, Daphne has a beau, I have a beau...

1172
01:30:17,575 --> 01:30:19,876
If we could only find somebody for you.

1173
01:30:22,661 --> 01:30:24,570
Here I am, doll.

1174
01:30:49,408 --> 01:30:53,116
"Friends of Italian Opera" - that's us.

1175
01:30:53,183 --> 01:30:55,092
Register over there.

1176
01:31:03,773 --> 01:31:07,350
Spats Colombo. Delegate from Chicago.
South Side Chapter.

1177
01:31:08,027 --> 01:31:09,619
Thanks.

1178
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:11,601
Hiya, Spats.

1179
01:31:11,675 --> 01:31:14,969
- We was layin' 8-1 you wouldn't show.
- Why wouldn't I?

1180
01:31:15,034 --> 01:31:17,782
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

1181
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:22,224
- We all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah. You never know who's next.

1182
01:31:22,297 --> 01:31:24,467
OK, Spats. Report to the sergeant at arms.

1183
01:31:24,536 --> 01:31:27,568
- What for?
- Orders from Little Bonaparte.

1184
01:31:32,854 --> 01:31:35,373
- All right, Spats, get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

1185
01:31:35,446 --> 01:31:38,478
Little Bonaparte don't want
no hardware around.

1186
01:31:38,549 --> 01:31:40,458
All right, you're clean.

1187
01:31:41,044 --> 01:31:42,953
You're not.

1188
01:31:52,722 --> 01:31:54,150
It ain't loaded.

1189
01:32:02,512 --> 01:32:05,228
Next. What's in here?

1190
01:32:05,295 --> 01:32:09,417
My golf clubs. Putter, niblick, No.3 iron.

1191
01:32:09,486 --> 01:32:11,395
- What's this?
- My mashie.

1192
01:32:16,876 --> 01:32:18,785
See you at the banquet, Spats.

1193
01:32:20,235 --> 01:32:22,536
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

1194
01:32:23,242 --> 01:32:25,151
Come on, boys.

1195
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:28,711
Well. Spats Colombo, if I ever saw one.

1196
01:32:28,778 --> 01:32:30,882
Hello, copper.
What brings you to Florida?

1197
01:32:30,953 --> 01:32:32,839
I heard you opera-lovers were meetin'.

1198
01:32:32,904 --> 01:32:36,001
Thought I'd come in case
anybody decided to sing.

1199
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:37,118
Big joke.

1200
01:32:37,191 --> 01:32:39,710
Where were you at 3pm
on St Valentine's Day?

1201
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:42,629
- I was at Rigoletto.
- What's his first name and address?

1202
01:32:42,694 --> 01:32:44,002
It's an opera, you ignoramus.

1203
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:47,997
- In the garage on Clark Street?
- Clark Street? Never heard of it.

1204
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:51,483
Ever hear of Deluxe Cleaners
on Wabash Avenue?

1205
01:32:51,556 --> 01:32:54,751
The day after the shoot
you sent in spats with blood on 'em.

1206
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:56,542
I cut myself while shaving.

1207
01:32:56,611 --> 01:32:59,065
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

1208
01:32:59,139 --> 01:33:02,815
Stop kidding. You vulcanized
Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

1209
01:33:02,882 --> 01:33:03,961
You and who else?

1210
01:33:04,034 --> 01:33:07,829
Me and those two witnesses you
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

1211
01:33:07,904 --> 01:33:10,685
Boys, know anything about
any garage or witnesses?

1212
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:12,824
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

1213
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:15,540
Honest.

1214
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:21,237
Don't worry, Spats. One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

1215
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:24,026
That's what you'll have to do - dig 'em up.

1216
01:33:33,051 --> 01:33:37,305
I feel like such a tramp, taking jewelry
from a man under false pretenses.

1217
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:41,078
Get it while you're young. Fix your lips
if you wanna look nice for Osgood.

1218
01:33:41,145 --> 01:33:43,599
It'll break his heart when
he finds out I can't marry him.

1219
01:33:43,672 --> 01:33:46,932
It'll break Sugar's heart when
she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

1220
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,170
Can't make an omelet
without breakin' an egg.

1221
01:33:49,239 --> 01:33:51,889
- What's with the omelet?
- Nag, nag, nag.

1222
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:56,692
We got a yacht, a bracelet, you've got
Osgood, I've got Sugar. We'll be cookin'.

1223
01:34:00,501 --> 01:34:02,410
- Joe!
- What?

1224
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:06,994
Something tells me the omelet
is about to hit the fan.

1225
01:34:09,426 --> 01:34:11,335
Come on, Daphne.

1226
01:34:15,537 --> 01:34:17,446
- Going up.
- Hold it.

1227
01:34:25,103 --> 01:34:26,826
Three, please.

1228
01:34:37,453 --> 01:34:39,078
I don't mean to be forward,

1229
01:34:39,148 --> 01:34:42,180
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meetin' you two broads before?

1230
01:34:42,252 --> 01:34:45,218
- Oh, no.
- You must mean two other broads.

1231
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:48,038
- You ever been in Chicago?
- Us?

1232
01:34:48,106 --> 01:34:50,723
We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

1233
01:34:50,793 --> 01:34:51,872
Third floor.

1234
01:34:51,946 --> 01:34:54,880
- What floor are you on, sweetie?
- Never you mind.

1235
01:34:56,072 --> 01:34:57,981
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

1236
01:34:58,056 --> 01:34:59,965
Don't call us. We'll call you.

1237
01:35:12,997 --> 01:35:14,490
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

1238
01:35:14,564 --> 01:35:17,824
They're gonna line us up
against the wall and...

1239
01:35:17,891 --> 01:35:20,890
The cops will find two dead dames
and take us to the morgue

1240
01:35:20,962 --> 01:35:23,449
and when they undress us,
I'll die of shame.

1241
01:35:23,523 --> 01:35:26,457
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah. OK, Joe.

1242
01:35:26,529 --> 01:35:28,667
- Not that, you idiot.
- They're from Osgood.

1243
01:35:28,737 --> 01:35:30,646
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

1244
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:37,566
I tell you, I will never find
another man who's so good to me.

1245
01:35:37,631 --> 01:35:42,005
Joe, if we get outta this hotel alive,
we'll sell this bracelet, take the money,

1246
01:35:42,078 --> 01:35:45,110
grab a boat to South America
and hide out in a banana republic.

1247
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:48,857
I figured if we eat nothing but bananas,
we could live there for 50 years.

1248
01:35:48,925 --> 01:35:50,834
If we get outta the hotel alive.

1249
01:35:50,908 --> 01:35:53,776
- Did we forget anything?
- Yeah. The shaving stuff.

1250
01:35:53,851 --> 01:35:55,989
- And also Sugar.
- Sugar?

1251
01:35:56,058 --> 01:35:58,032
- Give me room 414.
- What are you doin'?

1252
01:35:58,106 --> 01:36:00,472
- Making a telephone call.
- Who has time?

1253
01:36:00,538 --> 01:36:03,025
We can't walk out on her
without a goodbye.

1254
01:36:03,097 --> 01:36:05,584
You usually walk out and leave 'em
with a kick in the teeth.

1255
01:36:05,656 --> 01:36:08,950
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

1256
01:36:09,016 --> 01:36:12,397
Mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be here any minute.

1257
01:36:12,472 --> 01:36:15,318
Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

1258
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:16,971
Ship to shore?

1259
01:36:17,046 --> 01:36:19,467
Hey, Sugar, it's for you. From the yacht.

1260
01:36:24,404 --> 01:36:27,785
Hello, my dearest darling.
It's good to hear your voice.

1261
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,769
I may throw up.

1262
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:35,727
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

1263
01:36:35,794 --> 01:36:39,535
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

1264
01:36:39,601 --> 01:36:42,055
I was still on the yacht
and the anchor broke loose.

1265
01:36:42,128 --> 01:36:44,582
We drifted for days and days.

1266
01:36:44,655 --> 01:36:46,694
You were the captain and I was the crew.

1267
01:36:46,768 --> 01:36:51,273
I kept a lookout for icebergs, I sorted
your shells and mixed your cocktails,

1268
01:36:51,342 --> 01:36:54,058
and I wiped the steam off your glasses.

1269
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:57,987
And when I woke up, I wanted
to swim right back to you.

1270
01:36:58,733 --> 01:37:00,161
Yes...

1271
01:37:00,908 --> 01:37:02,914
Now, about our date for tonight...

1272
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:05,763
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

1273
01:37:06,699 --> 01:37:09,000
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

1274
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:13,791
Not tomorrow either. I have to leave.

1275
01:37:13,865 --> 01:37:16,646
Something unexpected came up.
I'm sailing right away.

1276
01:37:17,608 --> 01:37:19,363
Where to?

1277
01:37:19,848 --> 01:37:21,757
South America?

1278
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:25,213
That is unexpected.

1279
01:37:26,342 --> 01:37:28,763
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

1280
01:37:28,838 --> 01:37:32,830
I just got a cable from Dad. The board
of directors have decided on a merger.

1281
01:37:33,285 --> 01:37:35,739
A merger? How long will you be gone?

1282
01:37:37,860 --> 01:37:39,615
Quite a while.

1283
01:37:39,683 --> 01:37:41,755
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

1284
01:37:42,723 --> 01:37:43,388
You're not?

1285
01:37:45,154 --> 01:37:48,448
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

1286
01:37:48,513 --> 01:37:53,051
It just so happens the president of the
Venezuelan oil syndicate has a daughter...

1287
01:37:53,536 --> 01:37:55,445
Oh. That kind of merger.

1288
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:57,277
What is she like?

1289
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:00,892
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

1290
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:02,900
But that's the way the oil gushes.

1291
01:38:02,974 --> 01:38:06,388
A man in my position
has a responsibility to the stockholders.

1292
01:38:06,461 --> 01:38:09,307
All those little people
who have invested their life savings.

1293
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:13,935
Of course. I understand.
At least, I think I do.

1294
01:38:14,012 --> 01:38:19,128
I knew you would. I only wish there
was something I could do for you.

1295
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:23,285
But you have. You've given me
all that inside information.

1296
01:38:23,354 --> 01:38:25,109
Tomorrow I'm gonna call my broker

1297
01:38:25,178 --> 01:38:28,493
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

1298
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:30,767
Smart move.

1299
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:33,588
By the way, did you get my flowers?

1300
01:38:33,656 --> 01:38:35,891
You know, those orchids
from my greenhouse?

1301
01:38:35,959 --> 01:38:40,180
The fog finally lifted over Long Island
and they flew them down this morning.

1302
01:38:40,246 --> 01:38:43,441
That's strange. I sent 'em to your room.

1303
01:38:45,525 --> 01:38:47,891
They should have been delivered by now.

1304
01:38:51,444 --> 01:38:54,956
Hey, Dolores, will you see
if there's any flowers outside?

1305
01:39:00,465 --> 01:39:03,399
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

1306
01:39:03,472 --> 01:39:06,537
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

1307
01:39:08,112 --> 01:39:10,021
What's this?

1308
01:39:10,959 --> 01:39:12,420
What's what?

1309
01:39:12,495 --> 01:39:15,112
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

1310
01:39:16,078 --> 01:39:17,987
Real diamonds.

1311
01:39:18,670 --> 01:39:23,109
They must be worth their weight in gold.
Are you always this generous?

1312
01:39:24,428 --> 01:39:25,954
Not always.

1313
01:39:26,028 --> 01:39:28,962
I wanted you to know how grateful
I am for what you did for me.

1314
01:39:29,290 --> 01:39:32,224
I didn't do anything. It just happened.

1315
01:39:33,962 --> 01:39:37,605
The navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

1316
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:41,283
Well, anchors aweigh,
and have a bon voyage.

1317
01:39:41,352 --> 01:39:43,173
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

1318
01:39:43,239 --> 01:39:45,442
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

1319
01:39:45,671 --> 01:39:47,580
Goodbye, my darling.

1320
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:51,297
I don't know about the captain but
the navigator's gettin' his tail outta here.

1321
01:39:51,365 --> 01:39:54,528
- Yeah, let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

1322
01:39:56,997 --> 01:39:58,720
What happened to my bracelet?

1323
01:39:58,788 --> 01:40:02,561
- Your bracelet? It's ours.
- OK. What happened to our bracelet?

1324
01:40:02,627 --> 01:40:06,903
- We did the right thing with it.
- You're not pullin' one of your old tricks.

1325
01:40:06,978 --> 01:40:09,213
No tricks, no mirrors,
nothing up my sleeve.

1326
01:40:09,282 --> 01:40:10,688
It's on the level this time.

1327
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,701
Where's that bourbon?

1328
01:40:25,534 --> 01:40:29,689
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know. All of a sudden I'm thirsty.

1329
01:40:31,197 --> 01:40:32,854
How did you get that bracelet?

1330
01:40:32,925 --> 01:40:34,811
- You like it?
- I always did.

1331
01:40:34,876 --> 01:40:39,511
Junior gave it to me. He's gone
to South America to marry another girl.

1332
01:40:39,579 --> 01:40:42,894
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

1333
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:46,863
If I were you, I'd take that bracelet
and throw it back in his face.

1334
01:40:46,937 --> 01:40:50,929
He's the first nice guy I've met in my life.
The only one that ever gave me anything.

1335
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:52,910
You'll forget him, Sugar.

1336
01:40:54,136 --> 01:40:59,252
How can I? No matter where I go, there'll
always be a Shell station on every corner.

1337
01:40:59,318 --> 01:41:01,521
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

1338
01:41:04,342 --> 01:41:07,636
Are you crazy? The place
is crawlin' with mobsters.

1339
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:10,960
And you're makin' like
Diamond Jim Brady.

1340
01:41:11,028 --> 01:41:12,937
How are we gonna get outta here?
How are we gonna eat?

1341
01:41:13,011 --> 01:41:16,806
- We'll walk. If we have to, we'll starve.
- There's that "we" again.

1342
01:41:16,882 --> 01:41:20,230
Not that way. We don't wanna
run into Spats and his chums.

1343
01:41:29,424 --> 01:41:30,797
Your hands clean?

1344
01:41:30,864 --> 01:41:31,976
Over.

1345
01:41:32,047 --> 01:41:33,956
OK, button my spats.

1346
01:41:37,486 --> 01:41:39,078
You sure dress nice, boss.

1347
01:41:39,469 --> 01:41:42,435
Say, boss. I've been talking
with the other delegates.

1348
01:41:42,509 --> 01:41:46,436
The word is, Little Bonaparte is real sore
over what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

1349
01:41:46,508 --> 01:41:50,369
- Him and Charlie was choirboys together.
- Stop or I'll bust out cryin'.

1350
01:41:50,443 --> 01:41:53,955
He even got Charlie's last toothpick
from the garage. Had it gold-plated.

1351
01:41:54,282 --> 01:41:56,005
Like I was tellin' you fellas.

1352
01:41:56,074 --> 01:41:59,269
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.
Hasn't got it here anymore.

1353
01:41:59,337 --> 01:42:01,638
Used to be like a rock.

1354
01:42:01,704 --> 01:42:06,405
- It's too bad. I think it's time he retired.
- Second the motion.

1355
01:42:07,047 --> 01:42:08,290
How are we gonna retire him?

1356
01:42:08,359 --> 01:42:10,300
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

1357
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:14,529
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie
will be singin' in the same choir again.

1358
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:20,832
But this time we'll make sure
there are no witnesses.

1359
01:42:23,748 --> 01:42:26,430
Look. The two broads from the elevator.

1360
01:42:29,570 --> 01:42:31,479
Hey. Join us.

1361
01:42:32,961 --> 01:42:35,327
What's the matter with those dames?

1362
01:42:35,393 --> 01:42:37,302
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

1363
01:42:40,192 --> 01:42:42,101
Same faces, same instruments.

1364
01:42:46,526 --> 01:42:49,460
- Here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

1365
01:42:49,885 --> 01:42:54,488
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here. Come on.

1366
01:43:12,505 --> 01:43:16,813
- All right, so what do we do now?
- First we gotta get out of these clothes.

1367
01:44:51,746 --> 01:44:52,541
What happened?

1368
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:56,056
Me and Tiny had them cornered,
but we lost them in the shuffle.

1369
01:44:56,129 --> 01:44:59,477
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you, at Rigoletto's.

1370
01:44:59,552 --> 01:45:02,966
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- Boss, we'll get 'em after the banquet.

1371
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:04,948
They can't be too far away.

1372
01:45:24,027 --> 01:45:25,968
Thank you.

1373
01:45:26,042 --> 01:45:28,048
Thank you, fellow opera-lovers.

1374
01:45:29,274 --> 01:45:33,102
It's been ten years since I elected myself
president of this organization,

1375
01:45:33,177 --> 01:45:36,525
and, if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

1376
01:45:38,936 --> 01:45:42,230
Let's look at the record.
In the last fiscal year,

1377
01:45:42,294 --> 01:45:45,806
we made $112 million before taxes.

1378
01:45:46,518 --> 01:45:48,110
Only we ain't payin' no taxes.

1379
01:45:51,124 --> 01:45:55,498
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

1380
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:58,730
Let us now observe one minute of silence

1381
01:45:58,803 --> 01:46:03,471
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, North Side Chapter,

1382
01:46:03,538 --> 01:46:06,635
who are unable to be with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

1383
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,057
You too, Spats.

1384
01:46:14,127 --> 01:46:15,882
Up.

1385
01:46:25,485 --> 01:46:27,045
Easy, now.

1386
01:46:27,117 --> 01:46:30,247
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah. Second time they sing:

1387
01:46:30,316 --> 01:46:34,438
For he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny.

1388
01:46:34,507 --> 01:46:36,099
OK.

1389
01:46:40,426 --> 01:46:44,451
And don't mess up the cake. I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

1390
01:46:52,196 --> 01:46:54,202
Now, fellow delegates,

1391
01:46:54,274 --> 01:46:57,950
there comes a time in the life
of every business executive

1392
01:46:58,018 --> 01:47:00,766
when he starts thinkin' about retirement.

1393
01:47:00,834 --> 01:47:02,426
No!

1394
01:47:04,865 --> 01:47:08,377
I'm lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes.

1395
01:47:08,448 --> 01:47:11,229
I've been considerin' several candidates.

1396
01:47:11,294 --> 01:47:15,067
For instance, there's
a certain party from Chicago,

1397
01:47:15,134 --> 01:47:16,726
South Side Chapter.

1398
01:47:18,909 --> 01:47:24,210
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats.

1399
01:47:24,284 --> 01:47:27,283
But I say he's a man who'll go far.

1400
01:47:27,963 --> 01:47:30,995
Some people say he's gone too far.

1401
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:35,638
But I say,
you can't keep a good man down.

1402
01:47:36,665 --> 01:47:38,671
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

1403
01:47:38,745 --> 01:47:41,395
The big noise he made
on St Valentine's Day,

1404
01:47:41,464 --> 01:47:44,724
that wasn't very good for public relations.

1405
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:49,165
And lettin' them two witnesses get away.
That sure was careless.

1406
01:47:50,582 --> 01:47:53,428
Don't worry about those two.
They're as good as dead.

1407
01:47:53,493 --> 01:47:55,499
I almost caught up with them today.

1408
01:47:55,573 --> 01:47:59,085
You mean you let 'em get away twice?

1409
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:02,699
Some people would say
that's real sloppy.

1410
01:48:02,771 --> 01:48:06,960
But I say: To err is human,
to forgive divine.

1411
01:48:07,026 --> 01:48:09,359
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

1412
01:48:09,426 --> 01:48:11,847
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday.

1413
01:48:11,921 --> 01:48:13,862
So we baked you a little cake.

1414
01:48:14,673 --> 01:48:16,428
My birthday?

1415
01:48:16,496 --> 01:48:18,350
Why, it ain't for another four months.

1416
01:48:19,024 --> 01:48:23,016
So we're a little early.
What's a few months between friends?

1417
01:48:23,086 --> 01:48:25,224
All right, boys. Now all together.

1418
01:48:25,295 --> 01:48:27,749
For he's a jolly good fellow

1419
01:48:27,822 --> 01:48:30,155
For he's a jolly good fellow

1420
01:48:30,221 --> 01:48:33,864
For he's a jolly good fellow

1421
01:48:33,933 --> 01:48:36,354
Which nobody can deny

1422
01:48:36,428 --> 01:48:38,761
Which nobody can deny

1423
01:48:38,828 --> 01:48:41,063
Which nobody can deny

1424
01:48:41,131 --> 01:48:43,464
For he's a jolly good fellow

1425
01:48:43,531 --> 01:48:45,701
For he's a jolly good fellow

1426
01:48:45,769 --> 01:48:49,412
For he's a jolly good fellow

1427
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:52,676
Which nobody can deny

1428
01:49:07,205 --> 01:49:08,960
Big joke.

1429
01:49:15,779 --> 01:49:17,818
Let's get outta here.

1430
01:49:20,674 --> 01:49:22,583
Get those two guys.

1431
01:49:29,696 --> 01:49:31,582
What happened here?

1432
01:49:31,647 --> 01:49:35,224
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

1433
01:49:36,766 --> 01:49:40,888
My compliments to the chef. Nobody
leaves this room till I get the recipe.

1434
01:49:40,957 --> 01:49:43,029
You wanna make a federal case of it?

1435
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:49,300
Yeah.

1436
01:50:15,893 --> 01:50:17,299
They slipped through our hands.

1437
01:50:17,365 --> 01:50:21,520
We're watchin' the train station, roads
and airport. They can't get away.

1438
01:50:21,588 --> 01:50:24,304
- Did you hear that?
- But they're not watching yachts.

1439
01:50:24,371 --> 01:50:27,785
- You're gonna call Osgood.
- What'll I tell him?

1440
01:50:27,858 --> 01:50:30,345
Tell him you're gonna elope with him.

1441
01:50:30,418 --> 01:50:33,002
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

1442
01:50:33,073 --> 01:50:37,032
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

1443
01:52:33,814 --> 01:52:35,220
Josephine.

1444
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:39,342
Bienstock!

1445
01:52:40,309 --> 01:52:42,097
Hey. That's no dame.

1446
01:52:42,580 --> 01:52:44,652
None of that, Sugar.

1447
01:52:44,724 --> 01:52:46,633
No guy is worth it.

1448
01:52:49,843 --> 01:52:51,752
Grab her.

1449
01:52:55,409 --> 01:52:57,164
Josephine?

1450
01:53:02,384 --> 01:53:06,157
- Osgood's meeting us at the pier.
- We're not on the pier yet.

1451
01:53:54,596 --> 01:53:55,740
Hi.

1452
01:53:55,812 --> 01:53:58,145
My friend Josephine,
gonna be a bridesmaid.

1453
01:53:58,211 --> 01:54:00,577
- Pleased to meet you.
- Come on.

1454
01:54:00,643 --> 01:54:02,300
She's so eager.

1455
01:54:15,903 --> 01:54:17,844
Wait for Sugar!

1456
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:25,178
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl.

1457
01:54:25,245 --> 01:54:28,440
- Sugar, what are you doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

1458
01:54:28,508 --> 01:54:30,417
Let's go.

1459
01:54:33,371 --> 01:54:34,897
You don't want me, Sugar.

1460
01:54:34,971 --> 01:54:37,425
I'm a liar and a phony.
A saxophone player.

1461
01:54:37,498 --> 01:54:39,831
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

1462
01:54:39,898 --> 01:54:41,391
I know. Every time.

1463
01:54:41,466 --> 01:54:44,563
Sugar, do yourself a favor.
Go back to the millionaires.

1464
01:54:44,633 --> 01:54:46,126
The sweet end of the lollipop,

1465
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:49,941
not the coleslaw in the face
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

1466
01:54:50,008 --> 01:54:52,495
That's right, pour it on. Talk me out of it.

1467
01:54:57,686 --> 01:55:00,107
I called Mama.
She was so happy, she cried.

1468
01:55:00,181 --> 01:55:02,765
She wants you to have
her wedding gown. It's white lace.

1469
01:55:02,837 --> 01:55:05,902
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

1470
01:55:07,411 --> 01:55:10,574
She and I, we are not built the same way.

1471
01:55:10,643 --> 01:55:13,130
- We can have it altered.
- Oh no, you don't.

1472
01:55:14,514 --> 01:55:17,677
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

1473
01:55:17,746 --> 01:55:19,119
Why not?

1474
01:55:19,185 --> 01:55:20,526
Well...

1475
01:55:20,592 --> 01:55:23,111
In the first place, I'm not a natural blonde.

1476
01:55:23,184 --> 01:55:24,907
Doesn't matter.

1477
01:55:24,975 --> 01:55:27,079
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

1478
01:55:27,151 --> 01:55:28,776
I don't care.

1479
01:55:28,847 --> 01:55:32,969
I have a terrible past. For three years
I've been living with a saxophone player.

1480
01:55:33,038 --> 01:55:34,793
I forgive you.

1481
01:55:36,397 --> 01:55:39,145
I can never have children.

1482
01:55:39,213 --> 01:55:43,041
- We can adopt some.
- You don't understand, Osgood.

1483
01:55:44,716 --> 01:55:46,691
- I'm a man.
- Well,

1484
01:55:46,759 --> 01:55:48,578
nobody's perfect.
