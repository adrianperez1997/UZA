1
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:11,179
With the coming
of the Second World War...

2
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:15,340
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,226
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:18,466 --> 00:01:20,980
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:24,223
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,141
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,704
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:39,026
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:50,344
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

10
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:52,935
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:01:53,186 --> 00:01:57,498
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

12
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,023
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,536
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:06,783
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:10,782
And wait and wait...

16
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:12,698
...and wait.

17
00:02:21,946 --> 00:02:23,459
To all officers:

18
00:02:23,626 --> 00:02:28,302
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,384
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:35,215
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:36,900
Important.

22
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,705
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:10,618
I don't think I have them on me.

24
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,977
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

25
00:03:14,146 --> 00:03:16,182
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:21,984
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,744
Halt!

28
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:25,945
Halt!

29
00:03:49,786 --> 00:03:52,425
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

30
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,975
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

31
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:57,819
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

32
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:00,381
Two German couriers
were found murdered in the desert.

33
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,495
The unoccupied desert.

34
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:04,095
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

35
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:07,736
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

36
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:14,182
Along with these unhappy refugees...

37
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:16,661
...the scum of Europe
has gravitated to Casablanca.

38
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:18,777
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

39
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:21,818
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

40
00:04:22,026 --> 00:04:23,937
This place is full of vultures.

41
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,745
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

42
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:29,261
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

43
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:33,143
What an amusing little fellow.

44
00:04:33,346 --> 00:04:34,574
Waiter.

45
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,818
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

46
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,261
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

47
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:57,343
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

48
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,582
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

49
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:26,901
Thank you, thank you.

50
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:31,185
May I present Captain Renault, police
prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

51
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,302
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

52
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:35,378
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

53
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,100
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

54
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:40,621
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

55
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:41,935
That is kind of you.

56
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,865
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

57
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:54,541
We Germans must get used to all
climates, from Russia to the Sahara.

58
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,777
Perhaps you
weren't referring to weather.

59
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:57,975
What else?

60
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,017
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

61
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:03,815
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

62
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,738
But we know already
who the murderer is.

63
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,901
Good. Is he in custody?

64
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:09,904
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

65
00:06:10,066 --> 00:06:13,422
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

66
00:07:06,786 --> 00:07:08,822
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

67
00:07:09,026 --> 00:07:10,937
I'll never get out of here.

68
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,063
I'll die in Casablanca.

69
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,416
But can't you make it just a little more?

70
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:16,535
Please?

71
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:19,982
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug on
the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

72
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,302
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

73
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:23,575
All right.

74
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:26,619
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything-

75
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:32,302
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

76
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:36,698
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night, here
from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

77
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:40,017
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

78
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,376
Remember, in cash.

79
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:49,935
Cheerio.

80
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:53,505
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

81
00:08:02,586 --> 00:08:03,780
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

82
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:06,546
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

83
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,063
He never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

84
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:12,982
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

85
00:08:13,186 --> 00:08:14,414
Perhaps if you told him...

86
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:17,060
...I ran the second-largest
banking house in Amsterdam.

87
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,575
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

88
00:08:19,746 --> 00:08:23,136
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

89
00:08:23,346 --> 00:08:25,735
We have something
to look forward to.

90
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,102
And his father is the bellboy.

91
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,019
Excuse me.

92
00:09:01,346 --> 00:09:03,462
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

93
00:09:03,746 --> 00:09:07,102
Of all the nerve. Who do you think-?
I know there is gambling in there.

94
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:10,306
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

95
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,344
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

96
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,458
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this...

97
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,701
...you're much mistaken.

98
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,464
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

99
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,744
Your cash is good at the bar.

100
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,818
What? Do you know who I am?

101
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,903
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

102
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:30,939
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

103
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:37,978
Watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

104
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:40,865
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

105
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,854
- But when you first came, I thought-
- You thought what?

106
00:09:45,306 --> 00:09:47,422
What right do I have to think?

107
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:53,500
May I?

108
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:57,020
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

109
00:09:57,186 --> 00:09:59,746
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

110
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,101
...today they are the honored dead.

111
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,976
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

112
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:07,255
I forgive you.

113
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:09,018
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

114
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:12,059
I forgot, you never drink with-
I'll have another, please.

115
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:14,624
You despise me, don't you?

116
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:16,902
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

117
00:10:17,106 --> 00:10:18,334
But why?

118
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:21,336
Do you object
to the kind of business I do?

119
00:10:21,986 --> 00:10:26,298
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot here if I didn't help them.

120
00:10:26,466 --> 00:10:30,857
That's not so bad. Through ways of
my own, I provide them with exit visas.

121
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:33,182
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

122
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,578
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

123
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:41,017
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

124
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:44,656
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

125
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:48,065
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

126
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:50,820
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

127
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:53,944
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

128
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:57,463
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

129
00:10:57,946 --> 00:10:58,935
Look, Rick.

130
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,179
Know what this is?

131
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:04,345
Something that even you
have never seen.

132
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:07,538
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

133
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:10,897
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

134
00:11:11,026 --> 00:11:12,015
One moment.

135
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:15,343
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

136
00:11:15,506 --> 00:11:18,225
And then, addio, Casablanca.

137
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:21,060
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow...

138
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,098
...just because you despise me,
you are the only one I trust.

139
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:26,104
Will you keep these for me, please?

140
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,945
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

141
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,745
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

142
00:11:31,906 --> 00:11:33,464
Please keep them for me.

143
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,736
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

144
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:38,137
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

145
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:41,059
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

146
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:43,215
Rick...

147
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:45,417
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

148
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,823
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my
good luck with your roulette wheel.

149
00:11:49,986 --> 00:11:51,055
Just a moment.

150
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:57,019
I heard a rumor those two German
couriers were carrying letters of transit.

151
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:03,017
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

152
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:07,014
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

153
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:26,459
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

154
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:28,218
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

155
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:30,775
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

156
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:34,058
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

157
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:37,662
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

158
00:13:37,826 --> 00:13:39,896
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

159
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:41,943
In refugees alone
we could make a fortune...

160
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,977
...if you'd work with me
in the black market.

161
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:46,455
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

162
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,581
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

163
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,781
Suppose we do.

164
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:53,255
When will you realize
that in this world today...

165
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,741
...isolationism is no longer
a practical policy?

166
00:13:55,986 --> 00:13:58,546
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

167
00:13:58,706 --> 00:13:59,741
Oh, I like it fine here.

168
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:01,299
He'll double what I pay you.

169
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:03,656
I ain't got time to spend
what I make here.

170
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:06,024
Sorry.

171
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,984
The boss's private stock...

172
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:13,501
- ... because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

173
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,500
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

174
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,546
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

175
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:30,780
Where were you last night?

176
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:33,141
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

177
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:36,663
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

178
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:39,100
Give me another.

179
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:41,905
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

180
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:44,182
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

181
00:14:44,386 --> 00:14:46,775
- Rick, I'm tired of having you-
- Sascha, call a cab.

182
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,221
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

183
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:51,854
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

184
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,103
Hey, taxi.

185
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,862
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

186
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:00,698
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

187
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,822
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

188
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,546
- And come right back.
- Yes, boss.

189
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,458
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

190
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,821
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

191
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:22,618
Someday they may be scarce.

192
00:15:23,106 --> 00:15:24,983
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

193
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:26,699
Maybe get her on the rebound.

194
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,902
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

195
00:15:38,786 --> 00:15:41,664
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

196
00:15:45,826 --> 00:15:47,418
The plane to Lisbon.

197
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:53,624
You would like to be on it?

198
00:15:53,826 --> 00:15:55,418
Why? What's in Lisbon?

199
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,543
The clipper to America.

200
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,340
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

201
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:04,300
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

202
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:07,266
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

203
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,018
It's a combination of all three.

204
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,581
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

205
00:16:11,746 --> 00:16:14,101
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

206
00:16:14,386 --> 00:16:17,423
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

207
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:19,738
I was misinformed.

208
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:23,500
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

209
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,385
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

210
00:16:26,746 --> 00:16:28,862
...and the cashier
would like some money.

211
00:16:30,146 --> 00:16:31,340
I'll get it from the safe.

212
00:16:31,506 --> 00:16:33,019
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I-

213
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:35,700
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

214
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,578
I'm awfully sorry.

215
00:16:42,946 --> 00:16:46,461
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

216
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:48,264
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

217
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,785
A murderer, no less.

218
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,822
If you're thinking of warning him, don't
put yourself out. He cannot escape.

219
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:57,655
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

220
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:03,700
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

221
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,902
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

222
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,499
It will amuse your customers.

223
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:10,057
Our entertainment's enough.

224
00:17:10,586 --> 00:17:12,577
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

225
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:15,175
Major Strasser
of the Third Reich, no less.

226
00:17:15,346 --> 00:17:17,416
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

227
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:20,054
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

228
00:17:20,226 --> 00:17:22,057
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

229
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:25,975
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

230
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:27,255
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

231
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:29,462
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

232
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:32,385
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

233
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:33,979
How observant you are.

234
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:36,900
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

235
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:38,015
Yeah?

236
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:40,501
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

237
00:17:41,586 --> 00:17:43,497
There are many exit visas
sold in this café...

238
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:45,423
...but we know
that you've never sold one.

239
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:47,976
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

240
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:50,341
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

241
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:51,700
That is another reason.

242
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:54,545
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

243
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:57,499
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

244
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:00,055
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

245
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:01,779
Victor Laszlo?

246
00:18:01,946 --> 00:18:04,414
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

247
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,497
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

248
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,976
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

249
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:13,024
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

250
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:15,183
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

251
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,422
- Manages what?
- His escape.

252
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:19,423
- But I just told you-
- Stop it.

253
00:18:19,586 --> 00:18:21,383
He escaped from a concentration camp.

254
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,417
The Nazis have chased him
all over Europe.

255
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:27,221
- This is the end of the chase.
- Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

256
00:18:27,426 --> 00:18:28,700
Is that a serious offer?

257
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,096
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

258
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,986
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

259
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:35,901
- Okay.
- Done.

260
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,940
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

261
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,342
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

262
00:18:42,546 --> 00:18:45,140
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

263
00:18:45,426 --> 00:18:47,940
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

264
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:50,457
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

265
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,702
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

266
00:18:52,906 --> 00:18:56,023
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

267
00:18:56,626 --> 00:19:00,062
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

268
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:03,463
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

269
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:05,298
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

270
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:08,704
Laugh if you will, but I happen
to be familiar with your record.

271
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:10,937
Let me point out just two items:

272
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:15,100
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

273
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:19,020
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

274
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,421
And got well paid for it
on both occasions.

275
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,821
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

276
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,175
Maybe.

277
00:19:26,186 --> 00:19:28,302
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

278
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:30,178
I have my orders.

279
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,698
I see. Gestapo spank.

280
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,579
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

281
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:38,983
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

282
00:19:39,186 --> 00:19:41,177
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

283
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,416
- I am-
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

284
00:19:43,586 --> 00:19:45,702
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

285
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,178
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

286
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:00,183
I have already given him the best...

287
00:20:00,306 --> 00:20:02,774
...knowing he is German
and would take it anyway.

288
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:07,903
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

289
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:14,580
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

290
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,296
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

291
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:24,377
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

292
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:29,021
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

293
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,417
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

294
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:34,497
Very well, sir.

295
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:37,858
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

296
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:41,502
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

297
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,145
I expected no less, captain.

298
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:44,865
Monsieur Ugarte.

299
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:50,061
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

300
00:20:51,386 --> 00:20:53,183
May I first please cash my chips?

301
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:02,546
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

302
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:25,377
Rick! Rick, help me!

303
00:21:25,626 --> 00:21:29,505
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

304
00:21:36,866 --> 00:21:38,140
Excellent, captain.

305
00:21:38,306 --> 00:21:40,866
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

306
00:21:41,026 --> 00:21:43,017
I stick my neck out for nobody.

307
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:46,895
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

308
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,462
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

309
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:01,296
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

310
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,263
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

311
00:22:03,426 --> 00:22:05,496
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

312
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,055
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

313
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:13,019
We are very honored tonight.

314
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:17,179
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the
Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

315
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:20,179
You repeat Third Reich as though
you expected there to be others.

316
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:22,854
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

317
00:22:23,946 --> 00:22:25,937
Do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

318
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,580
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

319
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,260
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

320
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,742
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

321
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:37,460
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

322
00:22:37,986 --> 00:22:41,023
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

323
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:42,858
There seems to be no secret about that.

324
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,465
Are you one of those people...

325
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:47,305
...who cannot imagine the Germans
in their beloved Paris?

326
00:22:47,426 --> 00:22:49,337
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

327
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:51,343
Can you imagine us in London?

328
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:53,859
When you get there, ask me.

329
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,421
Diplomatist.

330
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:56,701
How about New York?

331
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:59,096
Well, there are
sections of New York, major...

332
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:01,535
...that I wouldn't advise
you to try to invade.

333
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,819
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

334
00:23:04,986 --> 00:23:07,181
Rick is completely neutral
about everything.

335
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:09,456
And that takes in the field
of women too.

336
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,782
You were not always
so carefully neutral.

337
00:23:11,906 --> 00:23:13,737
We have a complete dossier on you.

338
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:19,499
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country. "

339
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:23,104
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

340
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,824
And also we know why you left Paris.

341
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,857
Don't worry,
we're not going to broadcast it.

342
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,220
Are my eyes really brown?

343
00:23:28,386 --> 00:23:31,458
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

344
00:23:31,626 --> 00:23:33,776
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

345
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,824
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

346
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:40,860
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

347
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,658
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

348
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:48,176
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

349
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,224
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

350
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,899
...until the day we marched in.

351
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:57,218
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

352
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,986
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

353
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:03,264
I admit he's clever. Three times
he slipped through our fingers.

354
00:24:03,426 --> 00:24:07,180
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

355
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:10,656
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

356
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,618
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

357
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:15,655
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

358
00:24:16,346 --> 00:24:17,335
Perhaps.

359
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:26,055
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

360
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:53,778
Two Cointreaux, please.

361
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:58,095
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

362
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:01,258
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

363
00:25:01,426 --> 00:25:04,224
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

364
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:07,458
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

365
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:11,775
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

366
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:16,304
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

367
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:18,895
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

368
00:25:19,106 --> 00:25:20,505
The ring is quite unique.

369
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:26,061
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

370
00:25:26,586 --> 00:25:27,575
What is your name?

371
00:25:27,786 --> 00:25:29,981
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

372
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:33,576
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

373
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:36,220
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

374
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:38,456
Such a bargain.
But that is your decision?

375
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:40,224
I'm sorry, it is.

376
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:44,062
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

377
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:46,177
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

378
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:47,461
Yes, what is it you want?

379
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,624
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

380
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:53,420
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

381
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:55,935
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

382
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:59,502
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

383
00:25:59,706 --> 00:26:01,503
May I present Miss llsa Lund.

384
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,984
I was told you were the most beautiful
woman ever to visit Casablanca.

385
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:07,864
That was a gross understatement.

386
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:09,295
You're very kind.

387
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:11,895
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

388
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:16,623
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

389
00:26:16,786 --> 00:26:18,139
It's a game we play.

390
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:21,224
They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

391
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:24,739
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

392
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:26,785
Somewhere I've seen him.

393
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,465
- Sam?
- Yes.

394
00:26:28,626 --> 00:26:30,298
He came from Paris with Rick.

395
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:31,865
Rick? Who is he?

396
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,540
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's.
Rick is...

397
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:36,179
- Is what?
- Mademoiselle...

398
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:38,866
...he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

399
00:26:38,986 --> 00:26:41,375
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

400
00:26:41,586 --> 00:26:44,976
But what a fool I am talking to a
beautiful woman about another man.

401
00:26:46,346 --> 00:26:47,335
Excuse me.

402
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,258
Major.

403
00:26:50,746 --> 00:26:53,738
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

404
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:54,895
How do you do?

405
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:56,977
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

406
00:26:57,186 --> 00:26:59,575
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

407
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:01,816
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

408
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:05,945
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now
you are a subject of the German Reich.

409
00:27:07,066 --> 00:27:10,376
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

410
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:14,181
I'd like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

411
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:15,904
This is hardly the time or place.

412
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:18,222
Then we shall state
another time and place.

413
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:20,337
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

414
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:21,695
With mademoiselle.

415
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,224
Captain, I am under your authority.

416
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:28,377
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

417
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:32,255
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

418
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:33,694
Very well.

419
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:40,664
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

420
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:44,741
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

421
00:27:45,146 --> 00:27:47,706
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

422
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,503
I must find out what Berger knows.

423
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:24,738
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

424
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,426
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

425
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:46,505
Champagne cocktail, please.

426
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:49,945
I recognize you from the news
photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.

427
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:52,939
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

428
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:55,984
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

429
00:28:56,186 --> 00:28:58,905
As you see,
it was true every single time.

430
00:28:59,106 --> 00:29:00,539
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

431
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:04,096
I'm looking for a man by the name of
Ugarte. He's supposed to help me.

432
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,941
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

433
00:29:07,106 --> 00:29:11,145
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

434
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:12,815
I see.

435
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:17,185
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

436
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:19,462
Underground, like everywhere else.

437
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,339
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

438
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,264
If you will come-

439
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:39,456
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

440
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:41,662
Very well, mademoiselle.

441
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:46,943
- How's the jewellery business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

442
00:29:47,106 --> 00:29:48,619
Too bad you weren't here earlier.

443
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,101
We had quite a bit of excitement,
didn't we, Berger?

444
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,745
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

445
00:29:52,906 --> 00:29:56,216
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

446
00:30:00,706 --> 00:30:02,901
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss llsa.

447
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:05,495
I never expected to see you again.

448
00:30:05,986 --> 00:30:07,704
It's been a long time.

449
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,784
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

450
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:15,424
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

451
00:30:25,066 --> 00:30:26,055
Where is Rick?

452
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:29,021
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

453
00:30:29,986 --> 00:30:33,217
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming-

454
00:30:33,386 --> 00:30:35,058
He went home.

455
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:39,265
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never-

456
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:41,701
Well, he's got a girl
up to the Blue Parrot.

457
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,897
Goes up there all the time.

458
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,986
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

459
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:51,983
Leave him alone, Miss llsa.
You're bad luck to him.

460
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,664
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

461
00:30:57,826 --> 00:31:00,101
I don't know what you mean,
Miss llsa.

462
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:02,139
Play it, Sam.

463
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:05,017
Play "As Time Goes By. "

464
00:31:05,426 --> 00:31:08,418
I can't remember it, Miss llsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

465
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:11,217
I'll hum it for you.

466
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:23,739
Sing it, Sam.

467
00:32:07,986 --> 00:32:10,625
Sam, I thought I told you never to play-

468
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:23,699
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present-

469
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:26,101
- Hello, llsa.
- Hello, Rick.

470
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:29,662
Oh, you've already met Rick,
mademoiselle? Then perhaps you also-

471
00:32:29,826 --> 00:32:31,100
This is Mr. Laszlo.

472
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:32,625
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

473
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:34,982
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

474
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:37,064
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

475
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:39,302
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never-

476
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:41,263
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

477
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,224
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

478
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:48,382
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

479
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:49,979
- What for?
- Your work.

480
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:51,784
Thank you. I try.

481
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:54,463
We all try. You succeed.

482
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,901
She was asking about you earlier, Rick...

483
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,335
...in a way that made me
extremely jealous.

484
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,665
I wasn't sure you were the same.

485
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:05,099
- Let's see, the last time we met-
- Was La Belle Aurore.

486
00:33:06,626 --> 00:33:08,457
How nice. You remembered.

487
00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:11,299
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

488
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:13,576
Not an easy day to forget.

489
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:17,901
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

490
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:21,734
Yes. I put that dress away.

491
00:33:21,946 --> 00:33:24,176
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

492
00:33:24,386 --> 00:33:28,299
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

493
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,778
llsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

494
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:34,580
So it is.
We have a curfew in Casablanca.

495
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:37,982
It would never do for the chief of police
to be found drinking after hours.

496
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:40,976
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

497
00:33:41,266 --> 00:33:42,779
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

498
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:46,422
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

499
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:50,380
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

500
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:52,218
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

501
00:33:52,386 --> 00:33:54,377
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

502
00:33:55,306 --> 00:33:59,185
There's still nobody in the world who
can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

503
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,061
He hasn't played it in a long time.

504
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:05,383
- Good night.
- Good night.

505
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,104
Night.

506
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,055
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

507
00:34:17,266 --> 00:34:20,338
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

508
00:34:20,546 --> 00:34:22,980
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

509
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,784
- Good night.
- Good night.

510
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:03,505
Boss?

511
00:35:06,986 --> 00:35:08,863
- Boss?
- Yeah?

512
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:12,258
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

513
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:15,264
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

514
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,502
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

515
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:20,058
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

516
00:35:20,226 --> 00:35:21,341
Good, then have a drink.

517
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:23,423
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

518
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:25,065
Boss, let's get out of here.

519
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:27,700
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

520
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,334
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

521
00:35:30,546 --> 00:35:32,423
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

522
00:35:32,586 --> 00:35:34,224
We'll take the car and drive all night.

523
00:35:34,426 --> 00:35:37,145
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

524
00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:41,504
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

525
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:49,175
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

526
00:35:50,466 --> 00:35:52,934
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

527
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,062
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

528
00:35:56,546 --> 00:36:00,505
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

529
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:02,061
What?

530
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:03,859
My watch stopped.

531
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:06,742
I bet they're asleep in New York.

532
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:09,540
I bet they're asleep all over America.

533
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:20,059
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

534
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:22,182
...she walks into mine.

535
00:36:29,306 --> 00:36:31,945
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

536
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,779
- Stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

537
00:36:34,946 --> 00:36:37,016
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

538
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:40,223
- I don't think I can remember-
- If she can stand it, I can.

539
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,415
Play it.

540
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,785
Yes, boss.

541
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:12,500
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

542
00:38:12,786 --> 00:38:14,742
What did you do,
and what did you think?

543
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:17,143
We said no questions.

544
00:38:21,626 --> 00:38:23,582
Here's looking at you, kid.

545
00:38:56,146 --> 00:38:57,818
A franc for your thoughts.

546
00:38:57,986 --> 00:39:00,295
In America they'd bring only a penny.

547
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:02,623
I guess that's about all they're worth.

548
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:07,255
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

549
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:09,584
Well, I was wondering...

550
00:39:11,346 --> 00:39:15,544
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

551
00:39:16,586 --> 00:39:18,702
Why there is no other man in my life?

552
00:39:20,946 --> 00:39:23,096
That's easy.
There was.

553
00:39:25,026 --> 00:39:26,459
He's dead.

554
00:39:27,346 --> 00:39:29,177
I'm sorry for asking.

555
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,101
I forgot we said no questions.

556
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,301
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

557
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:26,065
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

558
00:40:26,226 --> 00:40:29,024
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

559
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:32,542
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

560
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:18,694
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

561
00:41:18,866 --> 00:41:20,743
Says he'll water his garden
with champagne...

562
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:22,504
...before he'll let the Germans drink it.

563
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:25,823
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

564
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:27,220
You said it.

565
00:41:27,426 --> 00:41:29,257
Here's looking at you, kid.

566
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:57,337
My German's a little rusty.

567
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,099
It's the Gestapo.

568
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,659
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

569
00:42:05,826 --> 00:42:09,136
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

570
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:15,144
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

571
00:42:15,346 --> 00:42:16,904
It's pretty bad timing.

572
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:20,701
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
-10 years ago?

573
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,619
Let's see.

574
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:27,575
Yes, I was having a brace put
on my teeth. Where were you?

575
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:29,659
Looking for a job.

576
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:37,545
Was that cannon fire?

577
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:39,859
Or is it my heart pounding?

578
00:42:40,066 --> 00:42:43,945
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

579
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,216
And getting closer every minute.

580
00:42:49,346 --> 00:42:50,461
Here, here, drink up.

581
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,904
We'll never finish the other three.

582
00:42:53,106 --> 00:42:56,382
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

583
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:58,616
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

584
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:01,664
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

585
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:03,420
It's strange.

586
00:43:04,106 --> 00:43:07,815
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

587
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:10,261
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

588
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:14,259
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

589
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,535
No, we must leave.

590
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:17,825
Yes, of course. We.

591
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:21,621
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

592
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:24,698
Not at my hotel. I...

593
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:28,300
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

594
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:30,458
I'll meet you at the station.

595
00:43:30,706 --> 00:43:32,742
All right, at a quarter to 5.

596
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,738
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

597
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:40,864
That's too far ahead to plan.

598
00:43:41,026 --> 00:43:42,744
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

599
00:43:43,986 --> 00:43:47,422
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

600
00:43:47,866 --> 00:43:51,415
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that-

601
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:54,695
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

602
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,624
I love you so much.

603
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:07,575
And I hate this war so much.

604
00:44:09,426 --> 00:44:12,065
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

605
00:44:13,626 --> 00:44:15,503
If you shouldn't get away...

606
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:19,416
If something should keep us apart...

607
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:22,137
...wherever they put you...

608
00:44:22,306 --> 00:44:25,423
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

609
00:44:30,786 --> 00:44:31,980
Kiss me.

610
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:35,184
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

611
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:11,105
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

612
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:13,700
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

613
00:45:13,906 --> 00:45:15,897
But this note came just after you left.

614
00:45:30,426 --> 00:45:32,064
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

615
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:34,219
Do you hear me?

616
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:37,704
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

617
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:28,984
Rick, I have to talk to you.

618
00:46:30,306 --> 00:46:33,503
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

619
00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:36,660
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

620
00:46:38,066 --> 00:46:41,456
Why did you have to come to
Casablanca? There are other places.

621
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,896
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

622
00:46:44,626 --> 00:46:46,503
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

623
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,942
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

624
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,097
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

625
00:46:52,546 --> 00:46:55,777
- We'll get on a train and never stop. "
- Don't, Rick.

626
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,384
I can understand how you feel.

627
00:46:59,226 --> 00:47:01,262
You understand how I feel.

628
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,624
How long was it we had, honey?

629
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:06,616
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

630
00:47:06,946 --> 00:47:08,299
Every one of them.

631
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:10,777
Mostly I remember the last one.

632
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:15,341
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

633
00:47:15,506 --> 00:47:17,178
...with a comical look on his face...

634
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:19,257
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

635
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:23,256
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

636
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:25,815
Does it got a wild finish?

637
00:47:25,986 --> 00:47:28,056
I don't know the finish yet.

638
00:47:28,226 --> 00:47:31,502
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

639
00:47:33,866 --> 00:47:37,495
It's about a girl who had just come
to Paris from her home in Oslo.

640
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:39,304
At the house of some friends...

641
00:47:39,466 --> 00:47:42,219
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

642
00:47:42,386 --> 00:47:45,458
A very great and courageous man.

643
00:47:45,826 --> 00:47:48,021
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

644
00:47:48,186 --> 00:47:50,654
...full of knowledge
and thoughts and ideals.

645
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:54,775
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

646
00:47:54,946 --> 00:47:56,618
And she looked up to him...

647
00:47:56,866 --> 00:47:58,299
...and worshiped him...

648
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:01,185
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

649
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,382
Yes, that's very pretty.

650
00:48:03,546 --> 00:48:07,095
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

651
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:09,939
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

652
00:48:10,106 --> 00:48:12,336
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

653
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:17,621
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

654
00:48:19,826 --> 00:48:23,421
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

655
00:48:23,586 --> 00:48:24,655
Tell me...

656
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:27,582
...who was it you left me for?

657
00:48:27,746 --> 00:48:30,465
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

658
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:33,376
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

659
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:01,102
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

660
00:49:01,266 --> 00:49:03,541
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

661
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:06,618
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

662
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:08,822
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

663
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:11,454
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

664
00:49:11,626 --> 00:49:13,617
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

665
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:17,540
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

666
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:20,504
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

667
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,341
It may interest you to know that at
this very moment he's on his way here.

668
00:49:29,186 --> 00:49:31,746
There is nothing we can do.

669
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:35,266
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

670
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:36,375
I slept very well.

671
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:39,060
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

672
00:49:40,266 --> 00:49:43,975
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

673
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:49,337
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

674
00:49:49,506 --> 00:49:51,736
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

675
00:49:52,186 --> 00:49:53,665
You have reached Casablanca.

676
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,460
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

677
00:49:56,706 --> 00:49:58,697
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

678
00:49:58,866 --> 00:50:01,505
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

679
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:04,260
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

680
00:50:04,426 --> 00:50:06,656
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

681
00:50:06,906 --> 00:50:08,862
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

682
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:11,064
And mademoiselle?

683
00:50:11,226 --> 00:50:14,616
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

684
00:50:14,786 --> 00:50:17,584
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

685
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:20,306
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

686
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,297
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

687
00:50:22,466 --> 00:50:24,582
- On one condition.
- And that is?

688
00:50:24,866 --> 00:50:27,903
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

689
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:29,380
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

690
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,736
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

691
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,414
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

692
00:50:34,586 --> 00:50:37,100
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

693
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:38,938
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

694
00:50:39,226 --> 00:50:41,786
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

695
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:44,536
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

696
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:48,336
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

697
00:50:49,826 --> 00:50:52,215
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

698
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:55,224
...where you had more persuasive
methods at your disposal...

699
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:57,894
...I certainly won't
give them to you now.

700
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,621
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

701
00:51:00,826 --> 00:51:02,305
What if you murdered all of us?

702
00:51:02,466 --> 00:51:06,618
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

703
00:51:06,786 --> 00:51:09,016
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

704
00:51:09,186 --> 00:51:12,576
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

705
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:14,304
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

706
00:51:14,466 --> 00:51:16,900
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

707
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:18,545
But there is one exception.

708
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:21,214
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

709
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:24,184
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

710
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:26,776
You won't dare
to interfere with me here.

711
00:51:26,946 --> 00:51:28,425
This is still unoccupied France.

712
00:51:28,866 --> 00:51:31,585
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

713
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:34,340
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

714
00:51:34,506 --> 00:51:38,465
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

715
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:42,779
I believe you have a message for him?

716
00:51:42,946 --> 00:51:45,096
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

717
00:51:45,626 --> 00:51:48,538
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

718
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:50,458
Signor Ugarte is dead.

719
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,259
I'm making out the report now.

720
00:51:58,426 --> 00:52:00,894
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

721
00:52:01,546 --> 00:52:03,343
...or died trying to escape.

722
00:52:04,906 --> 00:52:07,500
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

723
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:09,139
Good day.

724
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:15,906
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

725
00:52:16,026 --> 00:52:17,015
Excuse me, captain.

726
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:20,104
Another visa problem has come up.

727
00:52:20,546 --> 00:52:23,344
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:34,578
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

729
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:37,385
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

730
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:39,662
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

731
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,340
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

732
00:52:42,546 --> 00:52:44,537
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

733
00:52:45,186 --> 00:52:46,778
Thanks.

734
00:52:58,146 --> 00:52:59,465
Don't be too downhearted.

735
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:01,657
Perhaps you can
come to terms with Renault.

736
00:53:01,826 --> 00:53:03,100
Thank you very much, signor.

737
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,575
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

738
00:53:05,746 --> 00:53:07,816
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

739
00:53:08,026 --> 00:53:09,982
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

740
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,420
I never drink in the morning.

741
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:14,185
And every time you send my
shipment over it's a little short.

742
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:16,223
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

743
00:53:16,386 --> 00:53:17,660
Here, sit down.

744
00:53:17,826 --> 00:53:20,386
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

745
00:53:20,546 --> 00:53:22,104
Bourbon.

746
00:53:22,346 --> 00:53:24,223
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

747
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:27,423
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

748
00:53:27,826 --> 00:53:30,499
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

749
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,622
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

750
00:53:32,786 --> 00:53:34,014
Practically no one.

751
00:53:34,226 --> 00:53:36,376
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

752
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:38,622
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

753
00:53:38,826 --> 00:53:41,056
I have a proposition
for whoever has those letters.

754
00:53:41,186 --> 00:53:42,699
I'll handle the entire transaction.

755
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:45,420
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

756
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,059
And the carrying charges?

757
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:49,865
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

758
00:53:50,546 --> 00:53:52,855
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

759
00:53:53,026 --> 00:53:54,505
I'll tell him when he comes in.

760
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,180
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

761
00:53:57,466 --> 00:54:00,538
You're in good company. Renault
and Strasser probably think so too.

762
00:54:05,986 --> 00:54:08,898
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

763
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:12,263
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

764
00:54:12,426 --> 00:54:14,303
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

765
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:18,735
Morning.

766
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:21,334
Signor Ferrari
is the fat gent at the table.

767
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:28,340
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

768
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:29,774
Only 700 francs.

769
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:33,023
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

770
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:36,178
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

771
00:54:36,386 --> 00:54:38,775
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

772
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:42,461
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive
you when you called on me last night.

773
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:43,575
Doesn't matter.

774
00:54:43,746 --> 00:54:47,534
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

775
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:50,618
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

776
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:52,344
I have some tablecloths, napkins-

777
00:54:52,506 --> 00:54:55,100
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

778
00:54:55,266 --> 00:54:58,736
Why did you come back? To tell me why
you ran out on me at the railway station?

779
00:54:58,906 --> 00:54:59,895
Yes.

780
00:55:00,066 --> 00:55:02,296
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

781
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:04,025
I don't think I will, Rick.

782
00:55:04,186 --> 00:55:06,654
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket.

783
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:08,299
I think I'm entitled to know.

784
00:55:08,466 --> 00:55:10,582
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

785
00:55:11,226 --> 00:55:14,298
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

786
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:16,934
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

787
00:55:18,426 --> 00:55:21,338
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

788
00:55:22,426 --> 00:55:26,305
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

789
00:55:26,466 --> 00:55:27,740
If we leave it that way...

790
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:31,097
...maybe we'll remember
those days and not Casablanca.

791
00:55:31,546 --> 00:55:32,615
Not last night.

792
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:36,383
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

793
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:39,299
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

794
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,104
You can believe that if you want to.

795
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:43,900
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

796
00:55:44,066 --> 00:55:45,818
Above a saloon, it's true...

797
00:55:45,986 --> 00:55:47,385
...but walk up a flight...

798
00:55:47,546 --> 00:55:49,184
...I'll be expecting you.

799
00:55:51,186 --> 00:55:53,859
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

800
00:55:54,026 --> 00:55:55,698
You'll be there.

801
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,135
No, Rick.

802
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:01,656
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

803
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:06,102
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

804
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:14,857
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that
unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

805
00:56:15,026 --> 00:56:16,857
You see, my dear,
word has gone around.

806
00:56:17,026 --> 00:56:19,699
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca...

807
00:56:19,826 --> 00:56:21,418
...I am influential and respected.

808
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:24,862
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

809
00:56:25,026 --> 00:56:26,778
You, however, are a different matter.

810
00:56:27,226 --> 00:56:31,424
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be
possible to get an exit visa for you.

811
00:56:31,826 --> 00:56:34,818
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

812
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:38,143
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while-

813
00:56:38,306 --> 00:56:40,058
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

814
00:56:40,226 --> 00:56:43,536
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

815
00:56:43,986 --> 00:56:46,022
We are only interested in two visas.

816
00:56:46,186 --> 00:56:48,381
- Please, llsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

817
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,697
You two will want to discuss this.

818
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,743
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

819
00:56:56,466 --> 00:56:58,184
No, llsa.
I won't let you stay here.

820
00:56:58,346 --> 00:57:01,577
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

821
00:57:01,826 --> 00:57:03,544
But if the situation were different...

822
00:57:03,706 --> 00:57:06,140
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

823
00:57:06,306 --> 00:57:07,580
...would you take it?

824
00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:09,775
Yes, I would.

825
00:57:10,946 --> 00:57:12,061
Yes, I see.

826
00:57:13,186 --> 00:57:16,940
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

827
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:19,222
When I was sick
in Marseilles for two weeks...

828
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:22,895
...and you were in danger every minute,
why didn't you leave me then?

829
00:57:24,146 --> 00:57:26,535
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

830
00:57:28,906 --> 00:57:30,305
I love you very much, llsa.

831
00:57:31,466 --> 00:57:33,502
Your secret will be safe with me.

832
00:57:34,506 --> 00:57:36,542
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

833
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:38,936
Not more than 50 francs.

834
00:57:43,466 --> 00:57:45,184
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

835
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:48,577
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

836
00:57:48,746 --> 00:57:50,623
Well, good luck, but be careful.

837
00:57:50,786 --> 00:57:53,505
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

838
00:57:53,826 --> 00:57:56,738
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

839
00:57:56,946 --> 00:57:59,540
I am moved to make one more
suggestion. Why, I do not know.

840
00:57:59,706 --> 00:58:01,503
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

841
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:04,743
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

842
00:58:04,866 --> 00:58:05,855
Yes, something.

843
00:58:06,026 --> 00:58:09,098
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

844
00:58:09,266 --> 00:58:11,177
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

845
00:58:11,386 --> 00:58:14,298
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

846
00:58:16,106 --> 00:58:19,178
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

847
00:58:19,386 --> 00:58:20,944
But it is worth a chance.

848
00:58:21,506 --> 00:58:24,179
Thank you very much.
Good day.

849
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:26,536
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.

850
00:58:26,666 --> 00:58:28,463
I shall miss that
when we leave Casablanca.

851
00:58:28,586 --> 00:58:30,861
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

852
00:58:31,026 --> 00:58:33,335
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

853
00:58:42,386 --> 00:58:43,944
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

854
00:58:44,426 --> 00:58:46,178
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

855
00:58:46,386 --> 00:58:49,981
I have to warn you, sir. This is
a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

856
00:58:50,146 --> 00:58:52,376
Vultures everywhere.
Thanks for everything.

857
00:58:52,506 --> 00:58:54,622
- Goodbye.
- It has been a pleasure to meet you.

858
00:58:54,786 --> 00:58:56,378
I'm sorry.

859
00:59:11,586 --> 00:59:15,101
Monsieur Rick, you are getting
to be your best customer.

860
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:19,341
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

861
00:59:19,506 --> 00:59:21,337
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

862
00:59:21,506 --> 00:59:23,736
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

863
00:59:23,906 --> 00:59:25,817
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

864
00:59:25,986 --> 00:59:28,181
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

865
00:59:28,346 --> 00:59:30,382
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

866
00:59:30,546 --> 00:59:32,377
You know how
that impresses Germans.

867
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:35,896
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

868
00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:38,262
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

869
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:43,144
Serves me right for asking a direct
question. The subject is closed.

870
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:45,821
It looks like you're a little late.

871
00:59:52,826 --> 00:59:54,418
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

872
00:59:54,586 --> 00:59:58,181
Who knows? In her own way, she
may constitute an entire second front.

873
00:59:58,586 --> 01:00:01,942
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

874
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:04,099
Sascha!

875
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:05,255
French 75s.

876
01:00:05,466 --> 01:00:08,981
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

877
01:00:09,146 --> 01:00:10,420
We will begin with two.

878
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:21,222
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

879
01:00:21,426 --> 01:00:24,657
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

880
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:34,101
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

881
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:39,785
You see, captain?

882
01:00:40,026 --> 01:00:42,301
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

883
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:44,303
We try to cooperate
with your government.

884
01:00:44,506 --> 01:00:46,656
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

885
01:00:46,826 --> 01:00:48,896
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

886
01:00:49,186 --> 01:00:51,256
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

887
01:00:51,466 --> 01:00:52,694
I blow with the wind...

888
01:00:52,866 --> 01:00:55,175
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

889
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:57,024
And if it should change?

890
01:00:57,266 --> 01:00:59,336
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

891
01:00:59,506 --> 01:01:01,497
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

892
01:01:01,706 --> 01:01:04,982
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

893
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:08,060
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

894
01:01:08,226 --> 01:01:09,705
A leader? Like Laszlo?

895
01:01:10,306 --> 01:01:11,580
I have been thinking.

896
01:01:11,906 --> 01:01:15,103
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

897
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:16,984
I see what you mean.

898
01:01:21,866 --> 01:01:23,663
Thank you, Carl.

899
01:01:23,866 --> 01:01:25,982
Thank you, Carl.

900
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:28,063
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

901
01:01:28,386 --> 01:01:30,695
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

902
01:01:30,866 --> 01:01:31,901
Thank you very much.

903
01:01:32,106 --> 01:01:34,745
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

904
01:01:34,946 --> 01:01:36,698
...and a third glass.

905
01:01:36,866 --> 01:01:38,777
At last the day's came!

906
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:41,665
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

907
01:01:41,826 --> 01:01:44,545
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

908
01:01:44,706 --> 01:01:46,298
A very nice idea.

909
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:49,504
- To America.
- To America.

910
01:01:56,786 --> 01:01:58,139
What watch?

911
01:01:58,946 --> 01:02:01,824
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

912
01:02:03,426 --> 01:02:05,656
You will get along beautifully in America.

913
01:02:06,626 --> 01:02:08,298
How is lady luck treating you?

914
01:02:08,506 --> 01:02:10,258
Oh, too bad.

915
01:02:10,586 --> 01:02:12,383
You'll find him over there.

916
01:02:18,346 --> 01:02:19,825
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

917
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:23,183
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in? You're underage.

918
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,501
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

919
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:26,940
My husband is with me too.

920
01:02:27,106 --> 01:02:29,745
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

921
01:02:29,866 --> 01:02:30,855
Have a drink?

922
01:02:31,026 --> 01:02:33,620
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

923
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:37,701
Monsieur Rick,
what kind of a man is Captain Renault?

924
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:39,339
Like any other man, only more so.

925
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:40,455
No, I mean...

926
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:42,378
...is he trustworthy?
Is his word-?

927
01:02:42,746 --> 01:02:44,976
Just a minute.
Who told you to ask me that?

928
01:02:45,106 --> 01:02:46,505
He did. Captain Renault did.

929
01:02:46,666 --> 01:02:48,657
I thought so. Where's your husband?

930
01:02:48,906 --> 01:02:53,024
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

931
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,904
Oh, of course he's losing.

932
01:02:55,106 --> 01:02:57,904
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

933
01:02:58,906 --> 01:03:00,464
We come from Bulgaria.

934
01:03:01,026 --> 01:03:03,176
Things are very bad there.

935
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,462
The devil has the people
by the throat.

936
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:08,260
So Jan and I, we...

937
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:11,020
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

938
01:03:11,226 --> 01:03:13,501
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

939
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:15,941
But we haven't much money...

940
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:18,461
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

941
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:20,822
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

942
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:25,459
And then Captain Renault sees us,
and he is so kind, he wants to help us.

943
01:03:25,586 --> 01:03:26,905
Yes, I'll bet.

944
01:03:27,026 --> 01:03:29,494
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

945
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,259
But we have no money.

946
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,059
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

947
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,456
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

948
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:38,459
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

949
01:03:39,546 --> 01:03:40,581
He always has.

950
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:47,502
You are a man.

951
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:50,226
If someone loved you very much...

952
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,465
...so that your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in the world...

953
01:03:55,026 --> 01:03:57,779
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

954
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:01,224
- ... could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

955
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:05,061
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

956
01:04:05,226 --> 01:04:06,944
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

957
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:09,176
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

958
01:04:09,666 --> 01:04:10,701
Go back to Bulgaria.

959
01:04:10,946 --> 01:04:14,985
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

960
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:20,099
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

961
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:23,576
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

962
01:04:23,746 --> 01:04:26,021
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

963
01:04:26,226 --> 01:04:29,218
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

964
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:38,814
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

965
01:04:38,986 --> 01:04:40,260
You see? Here we are again.

966
01:04:40,386 --> 01:04:42,377
I take that
as a great compliment to Sam.

967
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,663
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

968
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:49,223
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

969
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:51,656
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

970
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:54,375
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

971
01:04:54,546 --> 01:04:56,218
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

972
01:04:56,386 --> 01:04:58,138
Right this way, if you please.

973
01:04:58,306 --> 01:05:01,901
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By. "
I believe that's your favorite tune.

974
01:05:02,146 --> 01:05:03,340
Thank you.

975
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:14,900
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

976
01:05:37,026 --> 01:05:39,494
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

977
01:05:40,026 --> 01:05:41,664
No. No, I guess not.

978
01:05:41,826 --> 01:05:43,623
Have you tried 22 tonight?

979
01:05:45,146 --> 01:05:46,465
I said 22.

980
01:06:02,146 --> 01:06:03,420
Leave it there.

981
01:06:17,826 --> 01:06:19,578
Cash it in and don't come back.

982
01:06:22,266 --> 01:06:24,177
Are you sure this place is honest?

983
01:06:24,706 --> 01:06:28,381
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

984
01:06:31,226 --> 01:06:32,500
How are we doing tonight?

985
01:06:32,826 --> 01:06:35,386
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

986
01:06:38,946 --> 01:06:40,823
Monsieur Rick...

987
01:06:45,666 --> 01:06:47,224
He's just a lucky guy.

988
01:06:49,826 --> 01:06:52,579
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

989
01:06:52,746 --> 01:06:54,737
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

990
01:06:58,106 --> 01:06:59,539
Captain Renault, may I-?

991
01:06:59,706 --> 01:07:01,981
Not here.
Come to my office in the morning.

992
01:07:02,106 --> 01:07:03,744
We'll do everything businesslike.

993
01:07:03,866 --> 01:07:06,300
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

994
01:07:06,466 --> 01:07:08,218
I'm very happy for both of you.

995
01:07:08,386 --> 01:07:10,422
Still, it's very strange that you won.

996
01:07:10,586 --> 01:07:12,736
Well, maybe not so strange.

997
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:15,625
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

998
01:07:16,026 --> 01:07:17,539
No!

999
01:07:23,026 --> 01:07:25,824
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

1000
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:28,855
Go away, you crazy Russian.

1001
01:07:38,426 --> 01:07:41,224
As I suspected.
You're a rank sentimentalist.

1002
01:07:41,346 --> 01:07:42,381
Yeah? Why?

1003
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:44,303
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

1004
01:07:44,506 --> 01:07:46,258
Put it down as a gesture to love.

1005
01:07:46,426 --> 01:07:47,905
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

1006
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:50,785
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

1007
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:53,062
And it'll make me very happy
if she loses.

1008
01:07:56,986 --> 01:07:59,181
Mr. Blaine,
I wonder if I could talk to you.

1009
01:07:59,306 --> 01:08:01,695
- Go ahead.
- Well, isn't there some other place?

1010
01:08:01,906 --> 01:08:04,295
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

1011
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:08,336
- In my office.
- Right.

1012
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:11,906
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

1013
01:08:12,066 --> 01:08:14,944
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

1014
01:08:15,106 --> 01:08:16,824
You know what I've been doing.

1015
01:08:16,986 --> 01:08:20,740
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

1016
01:08:20,906 --> 01:08:23,101
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

1017
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,619
I'm not interested in politics.

1018
01:08:24,786 --> 01:08:27,175
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

1019
01:08:27,426 --> 01:08:28,495
I'm a saloonkeeper.

1020
01:08:28,826 --> 01:08:32,216
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

1021
01:08:32,386 --> 01:08:33,865
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

1022
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,664
You fought against
the fascists in Spain.

1023
01:08:35,786 --> 01:08:36,775
What of it?

1024
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,983
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

1025
01:08:40,186 --> 01:08:42,017
Yes, I found that
a very expensive hobby.

1026
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:44,376
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

1027
01:08:44,546 --> 01:08:47,743
Are you enough of a businessman to
appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

1028
01:08:47,906 --> 01:08:50,659
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
-200,000.

1029
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:53,460
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

1030
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,384
My answer would still be the same.

1031
01:08:55,546 --> 01:08:57,616
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

1032
01:08:57,826 --> 01:08:58,895
There is.

1033
01:08:59,346 --> 01:09:01,382
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1034
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:04,226
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1035
01:09:04,546 --> 01:09:06,855
- My wife?
- Yes.

1036
01:09:45,626 --> 01:09:47,537
Play "La Marseillaise. "
Play it!

1037
01:11:00,466 --> 01:11:04,300
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1038
01:11:04,466 --> 01:11:06,821
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1039
01:11:06,986 --> 01:11:08,897
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1040
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:12,019
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1041
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:13,335
The place is to be closed.

1042
01:11:13,506 --> 01:11:16,418
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1043
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,704
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1044
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,062
This café is closed until further notice.

1045
01:11:25,306 --> 01:11:26,819
Clear the room at once.

1046
01:11:30,146 --> 01:11:31,420
How can you close me up?

1047
01:11:31,626 --> 01:11:34,936
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1048
01:11:35,106 --> 01:11:36,937
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1049
01:11:37,106 --> 01:11:38,300
Everybody out at once.

1050
01:11:42,586 --> 01:11:46,340
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1051
01:11:46,506 --> 01:11:49,179
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1052
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:52,179
That is also true, except for one
destination: occupied France.

1053
01:11:52,386 --> 01:11:55,139
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1054
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:56,335
Of what value is that?

1055
01:11:56,506 --> 01:11:59,418
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1056
01:11:59,586 --> 01:12:02,703
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1057
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:04,777
The French authorities
may find a reason...

1058
01:12:04,906 --> 01:12:06,976
...to put him
in the concentration camp here.

1059
01:12:07,146 --> 01:12:08,215
The other alternative?

1060
01:12:08,386 --> 01:12:10,616
My dear,
perhaps you have already observed...

1061
01:12:10,746 --> 01:12:12,941
...that in Casablanca
human life is cheap.

1062
01:12:13,106 --> 01:12:14,380
Good night, mademoiselle.

1063
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:28,022
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1064
01:12:49,986 --> 01:12:51,897
Our faithful friend is still there.

1065
01:12:52,426 --> 01:12:54,860
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1066
01:12:55,106 --> 01:12:56,141
I must.

1067
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:59,616
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1068
01:12:59,786 --> 01:13:02,983
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1069
01:13:03,186 --> 01:13:04,938
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1070
01:13:05,106 --> 01:13:07,415
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1071
01:13:07,626 --> 01:13:09,184
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1072
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:12,146
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1073
01:13:12,986 --> 01:13:15,784
Victor, why don't you tell me
about Rick? What did you find out?

1074
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:18,221
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1075
01:13:18,386 --> 01:13:19,899
But no intention of selling them.

1076
01:13:20,066 --> 01:13:23,581
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1077
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:25,259
Did he give any reason?

1078
01:13:25,466 --> 01:13:28,583
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1079
01:13:28,786 --> 01:13:30,856
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife. "

1080
01:13:31,786 --> 01:13:33,504
I don't know why he said that.

1081
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:48,145
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1082
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,218
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1083
01:13:53,186 --> 01:13:55,575
- llsa, I...
- Yes?

1084
01:13:56,826 --> 01:13:58,976
When I was in the concentration camp...

1085
01:13:59,546 --> 01:14:01,980
...were you lonely in Paris?

1086
01:14:03,386 --> 01:14:05,297
Yes, Victor, I was.

1087
01:14:06,226 --> 01:14:09,059
I know how it is to be lonely.

1088
01:14:10,106 --> 01:14:12,336
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1089
01:14:14,266 --> 01:14:16,177
No, Victor, there isn't.

1090
01:14:20,626 --> 01:14:23,060
I love you very much, my dear.

1091
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:28,177
Yes, I know.

1092
01:14:28,986 --> 01:14:31,295
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1093
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:34,060
You don't even have to say it.

1094
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:35,898
I'll believe.

1095
01:14:37,946 --> 01:14:39,220
Good night, dear.

1096
01:14:41,146 --> 01:14:42,420
Good night.

1097
01:14:49,186 --> 01:14:51,746
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1098
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,145
Be careful.

1099
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,179
Of course I'll be careful.

1100
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:45,818
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1101
01:15:45,986 --> 01:15:47,704
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1102
01:15:48,346 --> 01:15:49,574
Two weeks, maybe three.

1103
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:51,902
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1104
01:15:52,106 --> 01:15:54,256
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1105
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:55,745
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1106
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:59,103
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1107
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:02,385
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1108
01:16:02,546 --> 01:16:05,538
- Then I am going to the meeting-
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1109
01:16:05,706 --> 01:16:06,855
I won't.

1110
01:16:07,986 --> 01:16:09,021
Good night.

1111
01:16:10,106 --> 01:16:11,619
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1112
01:16:27,586 --> 01:16:30,862
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1113
01:16:31,026 --> 01:16:34,223
I told you this morning you'd come
around, but this is ahead of schedule.

1114
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:35,580
Well, won't you sit down?

1115
01:16:35,746 --> 01:16:39,500
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1116
01:16:39,666 --> 01:16:42,817
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1117
01:16:43,026 --> 01:16:45,620
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1118
01:16:45,786 --> 01:16:48,300
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1119
01:16:48,466 --> 01:16:50,934
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1120
01:16:51,466 --> 01:16:53,138
I know how you feel about me...

1121
01:16:53,306 --> 01:16:55,945
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1122
01:16:56,106 --> 01:16:58,461
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1123
01:16:58,626 --> 01:17:00,537
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1124
01:17:00,706 --> 01:17:01,980
It was your cause too.

1125
01:17:02,186 --> 01:17:04,541
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1126
01:17:04,986 --> 01:17:07,580
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1127
01:17:07,786 --> 01:17:09,697
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1128
01:17:16,026 --> 01:17:19,416
We loved each other once. If those
days meant anything at all to you-

1129
01:17:19,586 --> 01:17:22,384
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1130
01:17:22,546 --> 01:17:25,856
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth-

1131
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:28,017
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1132
01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:31,098
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1133
01:17:35,146 --> 01:17:37,785
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1134
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:40,585
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1135
01:17:41,186 --> 01:17:42,380
One woman has hurt you...

1136
01:17:42,506 --> 01:17:45,145
...and you take your revenge
on the rest of the world.

1137
01:17:45,306 --> 01:17:47,740
You're a coward and a weakling.

1138
01:17:50,986 --> 01:17:53,739
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1139
01:17:54,786 --> 01:17:57,619
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1140
01:17:57,786 --> 01:18:00,380
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1141
01:18:00,546 --> 01:18:01,535
What of it?

1142
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:04,266
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1143
01:18:10,826 --> 01:18:12,578
Now, if you'll-

1144
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:16,094
All right.

1145
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:18,222
I tried to reason with you.

1146
01:18:18,386 --> 01:18:20,536
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1147
01:18:20,906 --> 01:18:23,898
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1148
01:18:25,426 --> 01:18:27,223
Put them on the table.

1149
01:18:28,986 --> 01:18:29,975
No.

1150
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:33,057
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1151
01:18:34,306 --> 01:18:38,140
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1152
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,417
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1153
01:18:43,746 --> 01:18:47,295
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1154
01:18:52,026 --> 01:18:53,823
Richard...

1155
01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:56,261
...I tried to stay away.

1156
01:18:56,626 --> 01:18:59,186
I thought I would never see you again.

1157
01:19:00,266 --> 01:19:02,621
That you were out of my life.

1158
01:19:22,066 --> 01:19:24,022
The day you left Paris...

1159
01:19:25,506 --> 01:19:27,417
...if you knew what I went through.

1160
01:19:29,026 --> 01:19:31,586
If you knew how much I loved you.

1161
01:19:32,546 --> 01:19:35,265
How much I still love you.

1162
01:19:48,586 --> 01:19:49,575
And then?

1163
01:19:51,546 --> 01:19:55,698
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1164
01:19:55,866 --> 01:19:59,256
They needed him in Prague, but there
the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1165
01:19:59,426 --> 01:20:01,064
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1166
01:20:01,226 --> 01:20:03,740
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp. "

1167
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:07,096
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1168
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,535
Then it came.

1169
01:20:08,746 --> 01:20:10,816
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1170
01:20:12,066 --> 01:20:14,455
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1171
01:20:15,826 --> 01:20:17,179
Then I met you.

1172
01:20:17,506 --> 01:20:20,703
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret?

1173
01:20:20,906 --> 01:20:23,864
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1174
01:20:24,066 --> 01:20:26,455
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1175
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:29,739
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1176
01:20:29,946 --> 01:20:33,097
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1177
01:20:33,266 --> 01:20:34,745
...and for those working with us.

1178
01:20:35,346 --> 01:20:37,576
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1179
01:20:38,586 --> 01:20:41,020
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1180
01:20:41,186 --> 01:20:43,495
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1181
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:46,658
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1182
01:20:46,986 --> 01:20:48,897
He was sick. He needed me.

1183
01:20:50,426 --> 01:20:52,940
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1184
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:56,894
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1185
01:20:57,906 --> 01:20:59,578
Well...

1186
01:20:59,906 --> 01:21:01,498
...well, you know the rest.

1187
01:21:04,346 --> 01:21:07,258
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1188
01:21:07,426 --> 01:21:08,541
What about now?

1189
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:10,655
Now?

1190
01:21:11,426 --> 01:21:12,905
I don't know.

1191
01:21:13,546 --> 01:21:16,458
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1192
01:21:17,626 --> 01:21:18,615
And Laszlo?

1193
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:22,103
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1194
01:21:22,266 --> 01:21:25,463
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1195
01:21:25,626 --> 01:21:27,059
All except one.

1196
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:29,819
He won't have you.

1197
01:21:31,906 --> 01:21:33,578
I can't fight it anymore.

1198
01:21:35,266 --> 01:21:37,496
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1199
01:21:40,386 --> 01:21:43,298
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1200
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,457
You have to think for both of us.

1201
01:21:46,426 --> 01:21:47,745
For all of us.

1202
01:21:51,226 --> 01:21:53,786
All right. I will.

1203
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,384
Here's looking at you, kid.

1204
01:22:01,106 --> 01:22:04,064
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1205
01:22:15,946 --> 01:22:17,937
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1206
01:22:18,106 --> 01:22:20,017
I'm afraid they caught
some of the others.

1207
01:22:20,146 --> 01:22:21,135
Come inside.

1208
01:22:25,266 --> 01:22:29,942
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1209
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:31,864
Thank you.

1210
01:22:48,586 --> 01:22:50,656
Carl, what happened?

1211
01:22:50,826 --> 01:22:52,782
The police break up our meeting,
Herr Rick.

1212
01:22:52,906 --> 01:22:54,305
We escaped at the last moment.

1213
01:22:54,506 --> 01:22:56,701
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1214
01:22:56,866 --> 01:23:00,063
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1215
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:02,820
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1216
01:23:03,506 --> 01:23:05,656
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1217
01:23:13,026 --> 01:23:16,382
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1218
01:23:26,906 --> 01:23:29,898
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1219
01:23:30,066 --> 01:23:31,738
This might come in handy.

1220
01:23:31,946 --> 01:23:33,015
Thank you.

1221
01:23:33,226 --> 01:23:35,740
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1222
01:23:37,666 --> 01:23:40,305
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1223
01:23:40,466 --> 01:23:42,297
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1224
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:45,302
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1225
01:23:45,466 --> 01:23:46,945
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1226
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:49,461
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1227
01:23:49,626 --> 01:23:51,776
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1228
01:23:51,946 --> 01:23:54,016
You know how you sound,
Monsieur Blaine?

1229
01:23:54,186 --> 01:23:56,336
Like a man
who's trying to convince himself...

1230
01:23:56,466 --> 01:23:58,661
...of something
he doesn't believe in his heart.

1231
01:23:58,786 --> 01:24:01,823
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1232
01:24:02,306 --> 01:24:04,740
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1233
01:24:05,066 --> 01:24:08,058
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1234
01:24:08,226 --> 01:24:09,739
...and that you'll never succeed.

1235
01:24:09,906 --> 01:24:12,056
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1236
01:24:13,786 --> 01:24:16,254
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1237
01:24:16,626 --> 01:24:18,742
I know that you're in love
with a woman.

1238
01:24:18,946 --> 01:24:20,618
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1239
01:24:20,786 --> 01:24:23,584
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1240
01:24:23,746 --> 01:24:25,816
The first evening I came into this café...

1241
01:24:25,986 --> 01:24:28,216
...I knew there was something
between you and llsa.

1242
01:24:29,026 --> 01:24:30,618
Since no one is to blame...

1243
01:24:31,026 --> 01:24:32,937
...I demand no explanation.

1244
01:24:33,106 --> 01:24:36,257
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1245
01:24:36,426 --> 01:24:37,939
All right.

1246
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,937
But I want my wife to be safe.

1247
01:24:40,226 --> 01:24:41,579
I ask you as a favor...

1248
01:24:41,746 --> 01:24:44,544
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1249
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:45,775
You love her that much?

1250
01:24:45,986 --> 01:24:48,625
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1251
01:24:49,226 --> 01:24:51,660
Well, I am also a human being.

1252
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:53,899
Yes, I love her that much.

1253
01:25:01,386 --> 01:25:02,614
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1254
01:25:02,786 --> 01:25:05,220
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1255
01:25:05,346 --> 01:25:06,335
On what charge?

1256
01:25:06,506 --> 01:25:08,622
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1257
01:25:08,786 --> 01:25:11,425
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1258
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:26,699
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1259
01:25:26,866 --> 01:25:29,096
All you can do is fine him
and give him 30 days.

1260
01:25:29,226 --> 01:25:30,784
You might as well let him go now.

1261
01:25:30,946 --> 01:25:33,824
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1262
01:25:33,986 --> 01:25:35,419
If you were to help him escape-

1263
01:25:35,586 --> 01:25:37,895
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1264
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,421
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1265
01:25:40,586 --> 01:25:43,578
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1266
01:25:43,746 --> 01:25:46,704
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1267
01:25:46,866 --> 01:25:48,663
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1268
01:25:48,826 --> 01:25:50,145
They're all excellent reasons.

1269
01:25:50,306 --> 01:25:52,183
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1270
01:25:52,346 --> 01:25:55,656
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1271
01:25:55,986 --> 01:26:00,377
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1272
01:26:00,546 --> 01:26:01,979
Yes, I have the letters.

1273
01:26:02,146 --> 01:26:03,898
But I intend using them myself.

1274
01:26:04,266 --> 01:26:07,656
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1275
01:26:07,826 --> 01:26:10,784
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1276
01:26:10,946 --> 01:26:12,823
- What friend?
- llsa Lund.

1277
01:26:12,986 --> 01:26:16,422
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1278
01:26:16,586 --> 01:26:18,542
The last man I want to see in America.

1279
01:26:18,786 --> 01:26:21,823
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1280
01:26:21,986 --> 01:26:25,023
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1281
01:26:25,186 --> 01:26:27,746
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1282
01:26:27,906 --> 01:26:31,945
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to llsa and me.

1283
01:26:32,186 --> 01:26:34,063
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1284
01:26:34,226 --> 01:26:36,262
...but people have been held
in Casablanca...

1285
01:26:36,386 --> 01:26:37,978
...in spite of their legal rights.

1286
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:39,903
What makes you think
we want to hold you?

1287
01:26:40,026 --> 01:26:41,015
llsa is Laszlo's wife.

1288
01:26:41,186 --> 01:26:43,746
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1289
01:26:43,906 --> 01:26:45,385
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1290
01:26:45,546 --> 01:26:48,936
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1291
01:26:49,106 --> 01:26:52,223
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1292
01:26:52,386 --> 01:26:54,900
- Be quite a feather in your cap, right?
- Certainly.

1293
01:26:55,066 --> 01:26:57,136
Germany-
Vichy would be very grateful.

1294
01:26:57,306 --> 01:26:58,295
Then release him.

1295
01:26:58,466 --> 01:27:01,026
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1296
01:27:01,186 --> 01:27:03,575
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1297
01:27:03,786 --> 01:27:06,300
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1298
01:27:06,546 --> 01:27:08,741
You get him, and we get away.

1299
01:27:08,906 --> 01:27:11,704
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1300
01:27:11,906 --> 01:27:14,579
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1301
01:27:14,786 --> 01:27:17,346
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1302
01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:19,736
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1303
01:27:19,906 --> 01:27:22,466
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1304
01:27:23,026 --> 01:27:25,335
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1305
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:28,225
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1306
01:27:28,386 --> 01:27:29,580
I'm gonna miss you.

1307
01:27:29,706 --> 01:27:32,698
You're the only one in Casablanca
who has less scruples than I.

1308
01:27:32,946 --> 01:27:34,140
Oh, thanks.

1309
01:27:34,786 --> 01:27:35,821
Go ahead, Ricky.

1310
01:27:36,026 --> 01:27:38,620
Call off your watchdogs
when you let him go.

1311
01:27:38,746 --> 01:27:40,577
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1312
01:27:40,706 --> 01:27:42,617
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1313
01:27:49,906 --> 01:27:52,374
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1314
01:27:52,546 --> 01:27:55,663
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1315
01:27:55,946 --> 01:27:59,143
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1316
01:27:59,346 --> 01:28:04,545
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1317
01:28:04,706 --> 01:28:07,379
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1318
01:28:07,546 --> 01:28:10,379
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1319
01:28:10,586 --> 01:28:12,895
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1320
01:28:13,066 --> 01:28:14,340
Well, so long.

1321
01:28:14,506 --> 01:28:17,418
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1322
01:28:17,586 --> 01:28:19,975
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1323
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:54,375
You're late.

1324
01:28:54,506 --> 01:28:57,543
I was informed when Laszlo
left the hotel so I knew I'd be on time.

1325
01:28:57,706 --> 01:29:00,618
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1326
01:29:00,786 --> 01:29:02,777
This place will never be
the same without you.

1327
01:29:02,986 --> 01:29:06,376
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1328
01:29:06,546 --> 01:29:09,185
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1329
01:29:09,346 --> 01:29:11,416
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1330
01:29:11,586 --> 01:29:12,701
Sam's piano.

1331
01:29:13,426 --> 01:29:15,257
Serves me right for not being musical.

1332
01:29:15,546 --> 01:29:16,535
Here they are.

1333
01:29:17,026 --> 01:29:18,664
You better wait in my office.

1334
01:29:27,986 --> 01:29:30,454
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1335
01:29:30,626 --> 01:29:31,615
Not yet.

1336
01:29:31,746 --> 01:29:33,304
But you were able to
arrange everything?

1337
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:34,461
Everything is quite all right.

1338
01:29:34,626 --> 01:29:37,504
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1339
01:29:37,666 --> 01:29:39,418
Please trust me.

1340
01:29:41,386 --> 01:29:42,580
Yes, I will.

1341
01:29:47,586 --> 01:29:51,499
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1342
01:29:53,226 --> 01:29:56,218
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1343
01:29:56,586 --> 01:29:58,417
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1344
01:29:58,586 --> 01:30:01,737
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1345
01:30:01,906 --> 01:30:04,136
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1346
01:30:04,306 --> 01:30:06,615
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1347
01:30:06,786 --> 01:30:08,139
Victor Laszlo.

1348
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:11,260
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1349
01:30:13,786 --> 01:30:15,458
The charge of accessory to the murder...

1350
01:30:15,586 --> 01:30:17,622
...of the couriers
from whom the letters were stolen.

1351
01:30:18,186 --> 01:30:21,303
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1352
01:30:21,506 --> 01:30:24,339
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank-

1353
01:30:25,106 --> 01:30:29,338
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1354
01:30:29,506 --> 01:30:31,417
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1355
01:30:31,586 --> 01:30:33,656
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1356
01:30:33,826 --> 01:30:35,578
...but I will if you take one more step.

1357
01:30:36,266 --> 01:30:38,416
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1358
01:30:41,506 --> 01:30:44,862
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1359
01:30:45,026 --> 01:30:47,096
I do. We've got time
to discuss that later.

1360
01:30:47,266 --> 01:30:48,779
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1361
01:30:48,946 --> 01:30:51,460
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1362
01:30:51,626 --> 01:30:53,935
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1363
01:30:54,106 --> 01:30:56,097
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1364
01:31:03,346 --> 01:31:05,337
Hello? Is that the airport?

1365
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:08,178
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1366
01:31:08,386 --> 01:31:10,820
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1367
01:31:10,986 --> 01:31:12,704
There's to be no trouble about them.

1368
01:31:13,106 --> 01:31:14,095
Good.

1369
01:31:14,506 --> 01:31:15,621
Hello?

1370
01:31:20,546 --> 01:31:21,865
My car, quickly!

1371
01:31:23,466 --> 01:31:24,535
This is Major Strasser.

1372
01:31:24,706 --> 01:31:27,061
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1373
01:31:27,226 --> 01:31:28,454
At once, do you hear?

1374
01:31:35,306 --> 01:31:37,262
Hello, radio tower?

1375
01:31:37,426 --> 01:31:40,384
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1376
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:43,021
Visibility, 11/2 miles.

1377
01:31:43,186 --> 01:31:46,940
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1378
01:31:47,106 --> 01:31:49,745
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1379
01:32:01,746 --> 01:32:04,385
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1380
01:32:04,546 --> 01:32:06,218
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1381
01:32:06,426 --> 01:32:08,496
Find Laszlo's luggage.
Put it on the plane.

1382
01:32:08,626 --> 01:32:09,661
Yes, sir.

1383
01:32:09,786 --> 01:32:10,775
This way, please.

1384
01:32:12,586 --> 01:32:15,578
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1385
01:32:15,746 --> 01:32:17,702
You think of everything, don't you?

1386
01:32:17,866 --> 01:32:20,221
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1387
01:32:20,386 --> 01:32:23,822
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1388
01:32:23,986 --> 01:32:25,499
I don't understand.
What about you?

1389
01:32:25,666 --> 01:32:27,702
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1390
01:32:27,866 --> 01:32:29,777
No. What has happened?
Last night you said-

1391
01:32:29,946 --> 01:32:31,664
Last night we said a great many things.

1392
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:33,657
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1393
01:32:33,826 --> 01:32:36,386
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1394
01:32:36,546 --> 01:32:39,106
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1395
01:32:39,266 --> 01:32:41,018
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1396
01:32:41,186 --> 01:32:43,939
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1397
01:32:44,106 --> 01:32:47,257
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1398
01:32:47,426 --> 01:32:49,621
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1399
01:32:49,786 --> 01:32:53,062
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1400
01:32:53,266 --> 01:32:55,416
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1401
01:32:55,586 --> 01:32:57,816
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1402
01:32:57,986 --> 01:33:00,739
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1403
01:33:00,946 --> 01:33:04,302
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1404
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:07,137
But what about us?

1405
01:33:07,306 --> 01:33:08,659
We'll always have Paris.

1406
01:33:08,826 --> 01:33:11,704
We didn't have- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1407
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:13,658
We got it back last night.

1408
01:33:14,546 --> 01:33:18,141
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1409
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:20,059
But I've got a job to do too.

1410
01:33:20,266 --> 01:33:21,699
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

1411
01:33:21,826 --> 01:33:23,862
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

1412
01:33:24,426 --> 01:33:25,905
llsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1413
01:33:26,066 --> 01:33:29,376
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1414
01:33:29,546 --> 01:33:32,140
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1415
01:33:32,306 --> 01:33:34,740
Someday you'll understand that.

1416
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:37,538
Now, now.

1417
01:33:39,106 --> 01:33:41,336
Here's looking at you, kid.

1418
01:33:55,866 --> 01:33:58,255
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1419
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,536
There's something you should know.

1420
01:34:00,746 --> 01:34:02,464
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1421
01:34:02,626 --> 01:34:05,618
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1422
01:34:05,786 --> 01:34:07,583
You said you knew about llsa and me.

1423
01:34:07,746 --> 01:34:10,465
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1424
01:34:10,626 --> 01:34:13,936
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, llsa?

1425
01:34:14,346 --> 01:34:15,540
Yes.

1426
01:34:15,706 --> 01:34:17,662
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1427
01:34:17,826 --> 01:34:21,182
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1428
01:34:21,346 --> 01:34:23,780
But that was all over long ago.

1429
01:34:23,946 --> 01:34:27,097
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1430
01:34:27,586 --> 01:34:29,144
I understand.

1431
01:34:29,306 --> 01:34:31,422
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1432
01:34:32,066 --> 01:34:33,818
I appreciate it.

1433
01:34:34,626 --> 01:34:36,344
Welcome back to the fight.

1434
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:38,935
This time I know our side will win.

1435
01:34:52,106 --> 01:34:54,176
Are you ready, llsa?

1436
01:34:55,986 --> 01:34:57,305
Yes, I'm ready.

1437
01:35:00,306 --> 01:35:01,625
Goodbye, Rick.

1438
01:35:02,466 --> 01:35:04,263
God bless you.

1439
01:35:05,546 --> 01:35:08,140
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1440
01:35:25,466 --> 01:35:27,297
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1441
01:35:27,466 --> 01:35:30,185
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1442
01:35:30,346 --> 01:35:31,620
What you just did for Laszlo.

1443
01:35:31,786 --> 01:35:34,095
That fairy tale you invented
to send llsa away with him.

1444
01:35:34,266 --> 01:35:36,496
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1445
01:35:36,706 --> 01:35:38,617
But she knew you were lying.

1446
01:35:38,786 --> 01:35:40,663
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1447
01:35:40,826 --> 01:35:43,977
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

1448
01:35:44,106 --> 01:35:45,255
Especially for you.

1449
01:35:45,386 --> 01:35:48,458
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1450
01:35:55,226 --> 01:35:57,057
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

1451
01:35:57,186 --> 01:35:59,381
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1452
01:36:01,826 --> 01:36:03,862
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1453
01:36:04,026 --> 01:36:05,982
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1454
01:36:08,186 --> 01:36:10,905
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1455
01:36:11,106 --> 01:36:14,223
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1456
01:36:16,106 --> 01:36:17,619
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1457
01:36:17,786 --> 01:36:19,583
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1458
01:36:33,986 --> 01:36:35,499
Major Strasser has been shot.

1459
01:36:40,066 --> 01:36:42,626
Round up the usual suspects.

1460
01:37:05,346 --> 01:37:07,416
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

1461
01:37:07,546 --> 01:37:09,138
...but you've become a patriot.

1462
01:37:09,266 --> 01:37:11,382
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1463
01:37:11,506 --> 01:37:13,417
I think perhaps you're right.

1464
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:40,735
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1465
01:37:40,906 --> 01:37:43,261
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1466
01:37:43,426 --> 01:37:47,055
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1467
01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:48,460
I could use a trip.

1468
01:37:48,666 --> 01:37:51,783
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1469
01:37:52,026 --> 01:37:54,779
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1470
01:37:54,946 --> 01:37:56,140
"Our" expenses?

1471
01:37:56,946 --> 01:38:00,985
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
