1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,920
I'd name you the Hand of the King.

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,830
I have a son, you have a daughter.

3
00:00:04,955 --> 00:00:06,446
We'll join our houses.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,344
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen,

5
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,429
and his sister Daenerys.

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,515
I give him a queen
and he gives me an army.

7
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:19,978
The Maester says the boy may live.

8
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,564
There are times you make me wonder
whose side you're on.

9
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:24,816
You know how much I love my family.

10
00:00:24,982 --> 00:00:26,902
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

11
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,529
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

12
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:30,910
And you are a Stark.

13
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:34,242
King Robert's bastards.
Jon Arryn checked them all down, why?

14
00:00:34,776 --> 00:00:36,536
The King has no true born sons.

15
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:38,341
- Do you love your children?
- With all my heart.

16
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,747
- No more than I love mine.
- And they're all Jaime's.

17
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:43,672
When the King returns from his hunts,
I'll tell him the truth.

18
00:00:43,797 --> 00:00:46,672
I want what I came for.
I want the crown he promised me.

19
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:48,715
A crown for a King.

20
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,301
He was no Dragon.

21
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:53,136
Fire cannot kill a Dragon.

22
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,934
The Lord Commander Mormont
requested you for his personal steward.

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,135
He wants to groom you for command.

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,854
Ned!
We were hunting.

25
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,314
By the time Robert dies,

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,109
- it will be too late for us.
- What about Stannis?

27
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,778
- Stannis is your older brother.
- This isn't about the succession.

28
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,799
He's not a King.
I am.

29
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:14,908
- We have a new King now.
- Your son has no claim to the throne.

30
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,451
Kill him! Kill all of them!

31
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:20,444
You are summoned to King's Landing
to swear fealty to the new King.

32
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,500
Joffrey puts my father in chains,
now he wants his ass kissed?

33
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,836
I'll go to King's Landing.
But not alone.

34
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,254
Call the banners.

35
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,924
- Kill him, Robb.
- He's more use to us alive than dead.

36
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:33,802
So long as I am your King,

37
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,221
treason shall never go unpunished.

38
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:39,891
You'll go to King's Landing.

39
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:42,102
And serve as Hand of the King
in my stead.

40
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,647
You will bring that boy King to heel
and his mother too, if needs be.

41
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:47,482
Please let me go home.

42
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:51,445
Mother says I'm still to marry you.
So you'll stay here and obey.

43
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,032
My sword is yours,
in victory and defeat.

44
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:56,867
The King in the North!

45
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,371
What's your name?
Arry the orphan boy.

46
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:04,583
It's a thousand leagues
from here to the Wall.

47
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,668
We'll ride out
beyond the Wall tomorrow.

48
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:09,921
The Night's Watch will ride in force
against the Wildlings,

49
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:12,356
the White Walkers
and whatever else is out there.

50
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,092
He will die tonight.

51
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,430
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs
in the Night Lands.

52
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,557
You don't understand...

53
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,351
Blood of my blood.

54
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:16,464
-= La Fabrique =-
www.sous-titres.eu

55
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,875
Well struck.

56
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:45,785
Well struck, Dog.

57
00:04:50,493 --> 00:04:51,750
Did you like that?

58
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,854
It was well struck, Your Grace.

59
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:56,031
I already said it was well struck.

60
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,728
Yes, Your Grace.

61
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:07,860
Who's next?

62
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:12,087
Lothor Brune, freerider
in the service of Lord Baelish.

63
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:15,732
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard.

64
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:21,500
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard!

65
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:22,989
Here I am.

66
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,454
Here I am.

67
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,857
Sorry, Your Grace.

68
00:05:34,025 --> 00:05:35,528
My deepest apologies.

69
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,379
Are you drunk?

70
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,376
No, Your Grace.

71
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,884
- I had two cups of wine.
- Two cups?

72
00:05:43,412 --> 00:05:44,932
That's not much at all.

73
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:47,430
Please, have another cup.

74
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:51,570
- Are you sure, Your Grace?
- Yes. To celebrate my name day.

75
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:54,104
Have two.
Have as much as you like.

76
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,492
I would be honored, Your Grace.

77
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:01,068
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

78
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,331
See that he drinks his fill.

79
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:23,489
You can't.

80
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,094
What did you say?

81
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:29,112
Did you say I can't?

82
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,510
I only meant

83
00:06:31,195 --> 00:06:33,900
it would be bad luck
to kill a man on your name day.

84
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:36,104
What kind
of stupid peasant's superstition...

85
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,113
The girl is right.

86
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:39,733
What a man sows on his name day

87
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,506
he reaps all year.

88
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,692
Take him away.

89
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,575
I'll have him killed tomorrow,
the fool.

90
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:55,123
He is.
A fool... you're so clever to see it.

91
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:58,520
He'll make a much better fool
than a knight.

92
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:00,902
He doesn't deserve
the mercy of a quick death.

93
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,460
Did you hear My Lady, Ser Dontos?

94
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,777
From this day, you'll be my new fool.

95
00:07:09,842 --> 00:07:11,313
Thank you, Your Grace.

96
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,987
And you, My Lady, thank you.

97
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:16,305
Beloved nephew.

98
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:26,369
We looked for you on the battlefield.

99
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:30,828
You were nowhere to be found.

100
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,700
I've been here, ruling the kingdoms.

101
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,992
What a fine job you've done.

102
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:39,584
Look at you.

103
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,984
More beautiful than ever.

104
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:44,646
And you!

105
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:47,342
You're going to be bigger
than the hound,

106
00:07:47,656 --> 00:07:49,691
but much better looking.

107
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,147
- This one doesn't like me.
- Can't imagine why.

108
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,309
- We heard you were dead.
- I'm glad you're not dead.

109
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:58,570
Me, too, dear.

110
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,021
Death is so boring,

111
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:02,688
especially now
with so much excitement in the world.

112
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:06,391
My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss.

113
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,813
Her loss?

114
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,974
Her father was a confessed traitor.

115
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,571
But still her father.

116
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:15,245
Surely having lost your own beloved
father you can sympathize.

117
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,432
My father was a traitor.

118
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,421
My mother and brother
are traitors, too.

119
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,164
I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.

120
00:08:28,924 --> 00:08:30,208
Of course you are.

121
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,991
Enjoy your name day, Your Grace.

122
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,685
Wish I could stay and celebrate,

123
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,741
but there is work to be done.

124
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:42,867
What work?

125
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,279
Why are you here?

126
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,946
The raven arrived from the Citadel

127
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:54,409
this morning, Your Grace.

128
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,745
The conclave has met,

129
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,123
considered reports from Maesters
all over the Seven Kingdoms,

130
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:03,418
and declared this great summer

131
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,296
done at last.

132
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:09,062
The longest summer in living memory.

133
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:12,855
The peasants say, a long summer
means an even longer winter.

134
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,665
A common superstition.

135
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,182
We have enough wheat
for a five-year winter.

136
00:09:17,376 --> 00:09:18,881
If it lasts any longer,

137
00:09:20,212 --> 00:09:21,553
we'll have fewer peasants.

138
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,663
The city's drowning in refugees,
Your Grace, fleeing the war.

139
00:09:25,788 --> 00:09:28,846
We have nowhere to house them.
And with winter coming, it'll get worse.

140
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:31,734
You command the City Watch,
do you not, Lord Slynt?

141
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:34,934
I do, Your Grace.

142
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,160
And are you not a Lord at my command?

143
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,728
I owe my title and lands
to your generosity, Your Grace.

144
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,270
Then do your job.
Shut the gates to the peasants.

145
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:45,781
They belong in the field,
not our capital.

146
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:47,897
Yes, Your Grace.

147
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:56,517
Don't get up.

148
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,641
More ravishing than ever, big sister.

149
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:04,110
War agrees with you.

150
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,565
Forgive the interruption.
Carry on.

151
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,061
What are you doing here?

152
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,197
It's been a remarkable journey.

153
00:10:15,046 --> 00:10:17,867
I pissed off the edge of the Wall,

154
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,745
I slept in a sky cell,

155
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,048
I fought with the hill tribes...

156
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:24,666
so many adventures,

157
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:28,199
so much to be thankful for.

158
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:32,333
What are you doing here?
This is the small council.

159
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,430
I do believe the Hand of the King is
welcome at all small council meetings.

160
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,097
Our father is Hand of the King.

161
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:42,174
But in his absence...

162
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,813
Your father has named Lord Tyrion

163
00:10:51,938 --> 00:10:54,487
to serve as Hand
in his stead while he fights.

164
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:56,162
Out! All of you out!

165
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:04,945
I would like to know
how you tricked father into this.

166
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,168
If I were capable of tricking father,
I'd be emperor of the world by now.

167
00:11:09,046 --> 00:11:10,627
You brought this on yourself.

168
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:14,377
- I've done nothing.
- Quite right... you did nothing

169
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:16,583
when your son called
for Ned Stark's head.

170
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,553
Now the entire North
has risen up against us.

171
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,055
- I tried to stop it.
- Did you? You failed.

172
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:24,309
That bit of theater
will haunt our family for a generation.

173
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,614
Robb Stark is a child.

174
00:11:25,739 --> 00:11:28,271
Who's won every battle he's fought.

175
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:31,309
Do you understand
we're losing the war?

176
00:11:31,434 --> 00:11:33,650
- What do you know about warfare?
- Nothing.

177
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,577
But I know people.

178
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,729
And I know our enemies hate each other
almost as much as they hate us.

179
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:47,707
- Joffrey is King.
- Joffrey is King.

180
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:50,126
You are here to advise him.

181
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,836
I'm only here to advise him.

182
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,732
And if the King listens
to what I say,

183
00:11:54,857 --> 00:11:57,989
the King might just get
his Uncle Jaime back.

184
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,304
How?

185
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,997
You love your children.

186
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,909
It's your one redeeming quality.
That and your cheekbones.

187
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,773
The Starks love
their children as well.

188
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,857
- And we have two of them.
- One.

189
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:17,522
- One?
- Arya, little animal, she disappeared.

190
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:20,117
Disappeared?
What, in a puff of smoke?

191
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:25,293
We had three Starks to trade.

192
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,248
You chopped one's head off
and let another escape.

193
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,032
Father will be furious.

194
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,592
It must be odd for you...

195
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,478
to be the disappointing child.

196
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:47,819
My Lord,

197
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,395
may the Old Gods
watch over your brother

198
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,986
and all our northern sons.

199
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:56,916
The walls of my holdfast
will not stand the winter.

200
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,671
The stones were last mortared
in the time of King Aerys,

201
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:03,073
and I'm afraid the masons today

202
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:06,073
are not fit to carry
their fathers' hammers.

203
00:13:07,182 --> 00:13:08,533
When I was a boy,

204
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:11,325
I remember seeing them
put up a new tower

205
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:14,077
at Torrhen's Square in a summer.</i>

206
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,097
Men worked back then.

207
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,304
Today,

208
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,892
my holdfast looks like it was built
by drunk children.

209
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,865
At night you can hear the wind
howling through the gaps.

210
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,143
And the Gods forbid it rains.

211
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:30,890
Why, I might as well sleep
beneath a waterfall.

212
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,603
Maintenance of a holdfast

213
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,898
generally falls
to the lord of that holdfast.

214
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,276
Generally, yes,
but I've sent all the young men off

215
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,904
- to fight Robb Stark's war.
- King Robb.

216
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,156
And it's not his war.

217
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,075
He didn't choose it.

218
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,586
Maybe not, but he called in his Banners
and took the men.

219
00:13:49,836 --> 00:13:51,455
Joffrey killed my father,

220
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,823
your liege lord.

221
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,280
Do you remember your vows, Ser?

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,005
Of course I remember!

223
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,330
We can spare four masons
for a week, My Lord.

224
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,400
Will that be sufficient
to repair your walls?

225
00:14:05,254 --> 00:14:06,721
I... I believe it will.

226
00:14:12,988 --> 00:14:15,103
We didn't want him here
all day, did we?

227
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:19,085
I didn't like the way
he was talking about Robb.

228
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,693
Nor did I.

229
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:26,683
But listening to people
you'd rather not listen to

230
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,644
is one of your responsibilities
as Lord of Winterfell.

231
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,833
Lord Portan.

232
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,037
My Lord,

233
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:40,588
may the Old Gods watch over your brother
and all our northern sons.

234
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,197
Boil this for an hour
and drink the tea.

235
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:38,020
- Makes all your pain go away.
- Don't have any pain.

236
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:40,606
Lucky for you.

237
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,159
That way.

238
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,815
You've been having
those dreams again.

239
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,616
I don't dream.

240
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,076
Everyone dreams.

241
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:53,703
I don't.

242
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,902
Heard some of the men
talking about the comet.

243
00:15:58,152 --> 00:15:59,572
They say it's an omen.

244
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:02,781
They say it means Robb will win
a great victory in the South.

245
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:04,032
Did they?

246
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,896
I heard some other fools
say it's Lannister red.

247
00:16:10,404 --> 00:16:13,347
Means the Lannisters will rule
all Seven Kingdoms before long.

248
00:16:14,196 --> 00:16:16,814
Heard a stableboy say
it's the color of blood

249
00:16:17,064 --> 00:16:19,136
to mark the death of your father.

250
00:16:23,513 --> 00:16:25,590
The stars don't fall for men.

251
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,338
The red comet means one thing, boy...

252
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:31,490
dragons.

253
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,558
The dragons are all dead.

254
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:38,467
They've been dead for centuries.

255
00:17:22,396 --> 00:17:24,729
What did your brother say
about them, Khaleesi?

256
00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:26,339
He said they ate meat.

257
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,100
He didn't tell you what kind of meat?

258
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,011
My brother didn't know
anything about dragons.

259
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:36,197
He didn't know anything
about anything.

260
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:12,174
She was Drogo's first gift to me.

261
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,052
I remember.

262
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,593
I promised to protect them.

263
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:22,138
Promised them their enemies
would die screaming.

264
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,713
How do I make starvation scream?

265
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:27,263
A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.

266
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,149
Does it ever end?

267
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,840
This is farther east
than I've ever been.

268
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,699
But, yes, Khaleesi,
everything ends, even the Red Waste.

269
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:39,362
And you're sure there's no other way?

270
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:42,106
If we go south to the land
of the Lazarheen,

271
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,576
the Lamb Men will kill us
and take your dragons.

272
00:18:44,826 --> 00:18:46,603
If we go west to the Dothraki Sea,

273
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:50,087
the first Khalasar we meet
will kill us and take your dragons.

274
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,631
No one will take my dragons.

275
00:18:54,043 --> 00:18:55,893
They are too weak to fight,

276
00:18:56,934 --> 00:18:58,384
as are your people.

277
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,889
You must be their strength.

278
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:03,569
As you are mine.

279
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,039
You never have.

280
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,877
This is bad time to start.

281
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:10,251
Having a rough time of it?

282
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,785
Nothing's killed me yet.

283
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:14,359
- Your ass killed the sledge.
- You offered me a ride.

284
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:17,401
I just wanted you to shut up about
your damn blisters.

285
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:33,821
I was born in a place like this.

286
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:37,171
Later, I fell on hard times.

287
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:40,729
Are those girls?

288
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,801
Craster's daughters.

289
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,400
I haven't seen a girl in six months.

290
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,682
I'd keep on not seeing them
if I were you.

291
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,986
What, he don't like people messing
with his daughters?

292
00:21:52,236 --> 00:21:54,646
He don't like people
messing with his wives.

293
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:58,442
He marries his daughters,

294
00:21:58,873 --> 00:22:01,987
and they give him more daughters.
And on and on it goes.

295
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,511
- That's foul.
- It's beyond foul.

296
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:09,461
All the other wildlings
for a hundred leagues have disappeared.

297
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:12,831
Craster's still here.
He must be doing something right.

298
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,544
What happens to the boys?

299
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,506
He marries his daughters.

300
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:23,487
What does he do with his sons?

301
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:29,911
He said he planned to stop here
on his way to the Frostfangs.

302
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,812
People make all sorts of plans.

303
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:35,016
I haven't seen Benjen Stark
in three years.

304
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,917
Haven't missed him.

305
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,464
Always treated me like scum.

306
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,473
Haven't had any good wine
for a long time.

307
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:46,595
You Southerners make good wine,
I'll give you that.

308
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,077
- We're not Southerners.
- Who's this little girl?

309
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:54,423
You're prettier
than half my daughters.

310
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:57,772
You got a nice wet twat
between your legs?

311
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,475
What's your name?

312
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,672
- Jon Snow.
- Snow, eh?

313
00:23:02,262 --> 00:23:04,098
Listen to me, bastard.

314
00:23:05,012 --> 00:23:08,382
All you lot from south of the Wall,
you're Southerners.

315
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:10,912
But now you're in the North,

316
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:13,934
- the real North.
- The lad meant no harm.

317
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:18,981
I catch that pretty little bastard
talking to my daughters...

318
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,830
No one will talk to your daughters,
you have my word.

319
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:26,267
Now, sit down and shut your mouth.

320
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:31,598
You bring any of that
good wine with you?

321
00:23:31,848 --> 00:23:33,076
We did.

322
00:23:33,326 --> 00:23:35,803
We passed through
six villages on the way here.

323
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,708
All six were abandoned.

324
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:40,669
Where have all the wildlings gone?

325
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,213
I could tell you, but I'm thirsty.

326
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:46,623
There's a barrel of Dornish wine
on the sledge.

327
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:48,010
Bring it in here.

328
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,510
Yes, commander.

329
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,472
You want to know
where they've all gone?

330
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,723
North...

331
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:56,481
to join up with Mance Rayder.

332
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,646
Your old friend.

333
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:02,072
He's no friend of mine.

334
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:05,861
He broke his vows,
betrayed his brothers.

335
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:10,741
But once he was
just a poor black crow.

336
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,913
And now he's King-Beyond-the-Wall.

337
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,422
He's been calling himself that
for years.

338
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,080
What's he king of?

339
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,206
A frozen lake somewhere?

340
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:22,657
That's a good-looking axe.

341
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:24,073
Fresh forged?

342
00:24:27,139 --> 00:24:28,147
Give it here.

343
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,625
You'll have another one
made at Castle Black.

344
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,751
Here.

345
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,216
That's some lovely steel.

346
00:24:41,258 --> 00:24:43,754
You want to know
what Mance Rayder is doing?

347
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,441
Gathering an army.

348
00:24:46,606 --> 00:24:50,182
What I hear, he's already got more men
than any of your southern kings.

349
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,157
And where does he plan
marching this army?

350
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,202
When you're all the way north,
there's only one direction to go.

351
00:24:58,994 --> 00:25:02,642
These are bad times
to be living alone in the wild.

352
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:05,381
The cold winds are rising.

353
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:09,711
Let them come.
My roots are sunk deep.

354
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,722
Wife...

355
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:15,555
tell the Lord Crow

356
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,598
how content we are.

357
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:19,926
This is our place.

358
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:21,936
Our husband keeps us safe.

359
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:24,852
Better to live free than die a slave.

360
00:25:27,968 --> 00:25:30,486
Don't it make you jealous, old man,

361
00:25:31,047 --> 00:25:34,575
to see me with all these young wives
and you with no one to warm your bed?

362
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,036
We chose different paths.

363
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:42,181
And you chose the path
with no one but boys on it.

364
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,253
You'll be wanting to sleep
beneath my roof, I suppose,

365
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,536
and eat me out of pigs.

366
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,224
A roof would be welcome.

367
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,071
It's been hard riding.

368
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:56,244
We've brought our own food
and good steel for you.

369
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:01,517
Any man lays a hand
on one of my wives,

370
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,208
he loses the hand.

371
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:10,009
And I see this one staring too long,

372
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:12,494
I might just gouge his eyes out.

373
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:16,357
Your roof, your rules.

374
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:31,039
Who am I?

375
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:33,533
Who am I?

376
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,845
Lord Commander.

377
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,182
And who are you?

378
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:38,897
Jon Snow.

379
00:26:39,022 --> 00:26:40,270
Who are you?

380
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,135
Your steward.

381
00:26:43,889 --> 00:26:45,497
You want to lead one day?

382
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,685
Then learn how to follow.

383
00:27:08,852 --> 00:27:09,878
Lord of Light,

384
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,626
come to us in our darkness.

385
00:27:13,476 --> 00:27:16,428
We offer you these false Gods.

386
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,782
Take them
and cast your light upon us...

387
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:24,905
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

388
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:29,313
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

389
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,446
After the long summer,
darkness will fall heavy on the world.

390
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,438
The stars will bleed.

391
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:41,738
We need to stop her.

392
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:45,663
The cold breath of winter
will freeze the seas...

393
00:27:46,452 --> 00:27:49,330
- Not now.
- And the dead shall rise in the North.

394
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:54,047
All you men were named
in the Light of the Seven!

395
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:58,384
Is this how you treat
the Gods of your fathers?

396
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,887
Are you so eager
to spit on your ancestors?

397
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:13,535
You smell of fear...

398
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:18,013
fear and piss and old bones.

399
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,199
Do you want to stop me?

400
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:27,066
Stop me.

401
00:28:40,842 --> 00:28:42,449
In the ancient books, it's written

402
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:45,850
that a warrior will draw
a burning sword from the fire.

403
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:50,089
And that sword shall be Lightbringer.

404
00:28:55,726 --> 00:28:57,610
Stannis Baratheon,

405
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,853
warrior of light,

406
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,199
your sword awaits you.

407
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,983
Lord, cast your light upon us!

408
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:41,821
For the night is dark
and full of terrors.

409
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:47,660
For the night is dark
and full of terror.

410
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,983
This woman will lead him
into a war he cannot win.

411
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:20,564
Stannis is our king.

412
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,480
We follow where he leads,
even if we don't like the path.

413
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:24,606
King.

414
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:28,951
Since that boar killed his brother,
every lord wants a coronation.

415
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,162
I don't serve the others.
I serve Stannis.

416
00:30:31,494 --> 00:30:32,643
As do I,

417
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,542
but loyal service
means telling hard truths.

418
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:40,774
He's surrounded
by fools and fanatics,

419
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,801
but he trusts you, Davos.

420
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:47,303
If you tell him the truth...

421
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,015
What's the truth?

422
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,182
"I declare upon the honor of my house
that my beloved brother Robert..."

423
00:31:07,307 --> 00:31:08,903
He wasn't my beloved brother.

424
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,994
I didn't love him.
He didn't love me.

425
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:15,081
- A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.
- A lie. Take it out.

426
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:20,860
"... that my brother Robert
left no trueborn heirs,

427
00:31:20,985 --> 00:31:23,271
"the boy Joffrey, the boy Tommen,
and the girl Myrcella

428
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:24,799
"being born of incest

429
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,927
"between Cersei Lannister
and her brother Jaime Lannister.

430
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,264
- "By right of birth..."
- The Kingslayer. Call him what he is.

431
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,602
"... And her brother Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

432
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:39,480
"By right of birth and blood,
I do this day lay claim..."

433
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,447
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister,
the Kingslayer.

434
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,111
Whatever else he is,
the man's still a knight.

435
00:31:45,484 --> 00:31:47,480
"Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer.

436
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:49,542
"By right of birth and blood,

437
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,626
"I do this day lay claim
to the Iron Throne of Westeros.

438
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:55,663
"Let all true men
declare their loyalty."

439
00:31:56,027 --> 00:31:58,074
When Eddard Stark learned the truth,
he told only me.

440
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,873
I'll not make the same mistake.

441
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:02,577
Send copies of that letter
to every corner of the Realm,

442
00:32:02,702 --> 00:32:04,827
from the Arbor to the Wall.

443
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:06,524
The time has come to choose.

444
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,157
Let no man claim ignorance
as an excuse.

445
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:12,552
The Lannisters are the true enemy.

446
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:14,473
If you could make peace
with your brother...

447
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,859
I'll not make peace with Renly
while he calls himself King.

448
00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:18,702
Many have already declared for him...

449
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:20,980
Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.

450
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:24,261
Stannis does not need to beg
this lord or that lord for support.

451
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:25,918
The Lord of Light stands behind him.

452
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,321
And how many ships
has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?

453
00:32:29,343 --> 00:32:30,698
He has no need for ships.

454
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,325
I'm sure he doesn't,
but we do if we're going to war.

455
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:36,693
If not Renly, Your Grace,
join forces with Robb Stark.

456
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:38,726
Who would steal
the northern half of my kingdom.

457
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:40,808
I serve thieves
according to their desserts,

458
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,344
as you well know, Ser Davos.

459
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,437
Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark,
they're all thieves.

460
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,799
They'll bend the knee
or I'll destroy them.

461
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:51,767
I owe you an apology, my King.

462
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,762
My duty is to serve.

463
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,512
You have chosen the new God
over the Old Gods.

464
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,588
May the Lord of Light
watch over us all.

465
00:33:02,938 --> 00:33:04,482
Shall we drink together?

466
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,085
Don't.

467
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:10,705
A cup of wine to honor
the one true God.

468
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:00,663
The night is dark and full of terrors,
old man,

469
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:03,779
but the fire burns them all away.

470
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:26,936
Your Grace.

471
00:34:39,228 --> 00:34:40,716
King in the North.

472
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,293
I keep expecting you to leave me in
one castle or another for safekeeping,

473
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:50,358
but you drag me along
from camp to camp.

474
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:55,164
Have you grown fond of me, Stark?
Is that it?

475
00:34:56,115 --> 00:34:57,803
I've never seen you with a girl.

476
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:01,660
If I left you
with one of my bannermen,

477
00:35:01,785 --> 00:35:03,861
your father would know
within a fortnight

478
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:07,923
and my bannerman
would receive a raven with a message:

479
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:12,029
"Release my son
and you'll be rich beyond your dreams.

480
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:15,222
"Refuse and your house
will be destroyed, root and stem."

481
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:18,950
You don't trust the loyalty
of the men following you into battle?

482
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:22,106
I trust them with my life,

483
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,264
just not with yours.

484
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:26,688
Smart boy.

485
00:35:27,688 --> 00:35:28,840
What's wrong?

486
00:35:29,499 --> 00:35:30,878
Don't like being called "boy"?

487
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,467
Insulted?

488
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:43,446
You insult yourself, Kingslayer.

489
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:47,797
You've been defeated by a boy.

490
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:51,232
You're held captive by a boy.

491
00:35:54,357 --> 00:35:55,945
Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy.

492
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:06,566
Stannis Baratheon sent ravens
to all the high lords of Westeros.

493
00:36:08,444 --> 00:36:11,669
King Joffrey Baratheon
is neither a true king

494
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:13,574
nor a true Baratheon.

495
00:36:15,255 --> 00:36:16,901
He's your bastard son.

496
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:19,135
If that's true,
Stannis is the rightful king.

497
00:36:19,301 --> 00:36:20,797
How convenient for him.

498
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,431
My father

499
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,527
learned the truth.

500
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,362
That's why you had him executed.

501
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,645
I was your prisoner
when Ned Stark lost his head.

502
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:33,528
Your son killed him so the world
wouldn't learn who fathered him.

503
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:34,654
And you...

504
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:39,155
you pushed my brother from a window
because he saw you with the queen.

505
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:45,888
You have proof?

506
00:36:47,566 --> 00:36:50,082
Or do you want to trade gossip
like a couple of fishwives?

507
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,341
I'm sending one of your cousins
down to King's Landing

508
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:53,925
with my peace terms.

509
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:56,468
You think my father's going
to negotiate with you?

510
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:59,431
You don't know him very well.

511
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,168
But he's starting to know me.

512
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,925
Three victories
don't make you a conqueror.

513
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:11,117
It's better than three defeats.

514
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,724
This city stinks...

515
00:37:45,321 --> 00:37:46,575
Like dead bodies.

516
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:48,766
A bit corpsey, yes.

517
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:50,900
And shit.

518
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:53,062
I thought you wanted to come here.

519
00:37:56,924 --> 00:37:57,925
I love it.

520
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:01,547
You love the smell
of dead bodies and shit?

521
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,571
And cum and garlic and rum.

522
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:07,940
You can smell cum from the balcony?

523
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,546
I love the stink.

524
00:38:10,671 --> 00:38:12,112
I love the noise.

525
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:14,417
Cities make me want to fuck.

526
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,587
And so did the country.

527
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,560
This is where I belong.

528
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,038
You need to be careful.

529
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:28,515
- No one can know you're here.
- No one will know.

530
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,266
You can't trust anyone
in King's Landing.

531
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:33,310
They're all liars...
good liars, bad liars,

532
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,377
one or two great liars.

533
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:37,437
What about you?

534
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,301
Me? I'm not from here.

535
00:38:39,426 --> 00:38:40,915
I'm a slave to the truth.

536
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:43,362
Truth?

537
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:48,065
You are the biggest little liar
I have ever met.

538
00:38:48,554 --> 00:38:50,369
Why do you think I am so little?

539
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:54,479
I'm being crushed
beneath the weight of all that truth.

540
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,759
Ned Stark actually slept on this.

541
00:39:02,442 --> 00:39:05,243
As if the poor man
didn't suffer enough.

542
00:39:07,863 --> 00:39:10,833
One of the many changes
we'll have to make around here.

543
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:23,658
Lord Baelish.

544
00:39:24,793 --> 00:39:25,843
Your Grace.

545
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:28,427
I wonder
if I might ask you for a favor.

546
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:29,829
Of course, Your Grace.

547
00:39:29,954 --> 00:39:32,022
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya...

548
00:39:32,147 --> 00:39:33,954
we can't seem to locate her.

549
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:36,514
If she's escaped the capital,

550
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,621
Winterfell seems
the logical destination.

551
00:39:38,746 --> 00:39:41,602
And yet my friends in the North
report no sign of her.

552
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:42,728
Curious.

553
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,557
If we choose to negotiate
with the Starks,

554
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:47,497
the girl has some value.
Whoever finds her...

555
00:39:47,622 --> 00:39:49,712
you know what they say
about Lannisters and debts.

556
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:52,140
You could ask Varys where she is.

557
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:55,915
He'll have an answer for you.
Whether you believe it...

558
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,441
Myself, I have always had
a hard time trusting eunuchs.

559
00:40:00,277 --> 00:40:01,870
Who knows what they want?

560
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,483
A mockingbird.

561
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:07,676
You created your own sigil,
didn't you?

562
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:08,802
Yes.

563
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:13,411
Appropriate for a self-made man
with so many songs to sing.

564
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,093
I'm glad you like it.

565
00:40:15,552 --> 00:40:18,952
Some people are fortunate enough
to be born into the right family.

566
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:21,210
Others have to find their own way.

567
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:24,413
I heard a song once

568
00:40:25,043 --> 00:40:27,095
about a boy of modest means

569
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:30,738
who found his way into the home
of a very prominent family.

570
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,972
He loved the eldest daughter.

571
00:40:33,138 --> 00:40:35,433
Sadly, she had eyes for another.

572
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:39,070
When boys and girls
live in the same home,

573
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,965
awkward situations can arise.

574
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:44,192
Sometimes, I've heard,
even brothers and sisters

575
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,395
develop certain affections.

576
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,387
And when these affections
become common knowledge,

577
00:40:50,493 --> 00:40:53,161
that is an awkward situation indeed,

578
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:55,230
especially in a prominent family.

579
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:57,788
But prominent families
often forget a simple truth,

580
00:40:58,991 --> 00:40:59,993
I've found.

581
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:03,251
And which truth is that?

582
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:05,881
Knowledge is power.

583
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,925
Seize him.

584
00:41:13,933 --> 00:41:15,263
Cut his throat.

585
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:18,864
Wait.

586
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:21,270
I've changed my mind.
Let him go.

587
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:25,900
Step back three paces.

588
00:41:27,842 --> 00:41:28,869
Turn around.

589
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:31,406
Close your eyes.

590
00:41:35,913 --> 00:41:38,038
Power is power.

591
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:43,647
Do see if you can take some time
away from your coins and your whores

592
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:45,586
to locate the Stark girl for me.

593
00:41:46,014 --> 00:41:48,078
I would very much appreciate it.

594
00:41:59,411 --> 00:42:01,101
You're Ser Alton Lannister?

595
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,291
I am, Your Grace.

596
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:07,274
I offer your cousins peace
if they meet my terms.

597
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,281
First, your family
must release my sisters.

598
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:15,343
Second, my father's bones
must be returned to us

599
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:17,347
so he may rest
beside his brother and sister

600
00:42:17,472 --> 00:42:19,464
in the crypts beneath Winterfell.

601
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:22,219
And the remains of all those
who died in his service

602
00:42:22,344 --> 00:42:23,832
must also be returned.

603
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:27,316
Their families can honor them
with proper funerals.

604
00:42:27,441 --> 00:42:29,963
- An honorable request, Your Grace.
- Third...

605
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:34,233
Joffrey and the Queen Regent
must renounce all claim

606
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:35,961
to dominion of the North.

607
00:42:37,227 --> 00:42:39,106
From this time till the end of time,

608
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,440
we are a free
and independent kingdom.

609
00:42:42,036 --> 00:42:43,533
The King in the North.

610
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:45,857
King in the North.

611
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,706
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men
shall set foot in our lands again.

612
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,152
If he disregards this command,

613
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,063
he shall suffer
the same fate as my father,

614
00:42:55,828 --> 00:42:56,865
only...

615
00:42:57,735 --> 00:43:00,057
I don't need a servant
to do my beheading for me.

616
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:02,955
These are... Your Grace, these are...

617
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:05,111
These are my terms.

618
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,219
If the Queen Regent and her son
meet them, I'll give them peace.

619
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:10,345
If not...

620
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,927
I will litter the South
with Lannister dead.

621
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:17,594
King Joffrey is a Baratheon,
Your Grace.

622
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,825
Oh, is he?

623
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,942
You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton.

624
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:25,745
That will be all for tonight.

625
00:43:41,658 --> 00:43:43,226
A word, Your Grace?

626
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,917
You don't have to call me "Your Grace"
when no one's around.

627
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,670
It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

628
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:52,714
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.

629
00:43:53,974 --> 00:43:55,883
The Lannisters are going
to reject your terms.

630
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,551
Of course they are.

631
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,487
We can fight them in the fields
as long as you like,

632
00:44:00,612 --> 00:44:03,599
but we won't beat them until you
take King's Landing.

633
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:08,090
And we can't take King's Landing
without ships.

634
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:11,186
My father has ships and men
who know how to sail them.

635
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,025
Men who fought my father.

636
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:15,438
Men who fought King Robert
to free themselves

637
00:44:15,563 --> 00:44:19,073
from the yoke of the South,
just like you're doing now.

638
00:44:20,718 --> 00:44:22,356
I'm his only living son.

639
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:26,324
He'll listen to me.
I know he will.

640
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,339
I'm not a Stark.
I know that.

641
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,173
But your father raised me
to be an honorable man.

642
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:39,271
We can avenge him together.

643
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:43,978
You don't want
Balon Greyjoy for an ally.

644
00:44:44,103 --> 00:44:46,353
I need his ships.
They say he has 200.

645
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:49,771
They say a million rats
live in the sewers of King's Landing.

646
00:44:50,496 --> 00:44:53,699
- Shall we rally them to fight for us?
- I understand you don't trust Greyjoy.

647
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:57,483
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy
because he is not trustworthy.

648
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:01,168
Your father had to go to war
to end his rebellion.

649
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,977
And now I'm the one
rebelling against the throne.

650
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,832
Before me, it was father.

651
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:08,956
You married one rebel
and mothered another.

652
00:45:09,547 --> 00:45:11,650
I mothered more than just rebels,

653
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:14,253
a fact you seem to have forgotten.

654
00:45:14,694 --> 00:45:16,617
If I trade the Kingslayer
for two girls,

655
00:45:16,742 --> 00:45:18,633
my bannermen
will string me up by my feet.

656
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,885
You want to leave Sansa
in the Queen's hands?

657
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:23,153
And Arya...

658
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,178
I haven't heard a word about Arya.

659
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,851
What are we fighting for?

660
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,614
It's more complicated than that!
You know it is.

661
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,999
It's time for me to go home.

662
00:45:50,935 --> 00:45:53,302
I haven't seen Bran
or Rickon in months.

663
00:45:54,826 --> 00:45:56,525
You can't go to Winterfell.

664
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,257
I beg your pardon?

665
00:45:59,727 --> 00:46:01,987
I'll send Rodrik
to watch over the boys

666
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:04,100
because tomorrow

667
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,930
you'll ride south to the Stormlands.

668
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,118
Why in the name of all the Gods...

669
00:46:09,243 --> 00:46:12,224
Because I need you to negotiate
with Renly Baratheon.

670
00:46:13,296 --> 00:46:15,508
He's rallied an army of 100,000.

671
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,076
You know him.

672
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:19,485
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon
since he was a boy.

673
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,903
You have lords...

674
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,646
Which of these lords
do I trust more than you?

675
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,787
If Renly sides with us,

676
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:29,730
we'll outnumber them two to one.

677
00:46:30,471 --> 00:46:33,429
When they feel the jaws beginning
to shut, they'll sue for peace.

678
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,629
We'll get the girls back.

679
00:46:36,176 --> 00:46:37,878
Then we'll all go home...

680
00:46:38,044 --> 00:46:39,013
for good.

681
00:46:47,751 --> 00:46:49,348
I will ride at first light.

682
00:46:58,494 --> 00:47:01,089
We will all be together again soon,
I promise.

683
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:08,645
You've done so well.

684
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:13,448
Your father would be... proud.

685
00:47:22,672 --> 00:47:25,099
- Give Lord Renly my regards.
- <i>King</i> Renly.

686
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,164
There's a king in every corner now.

687
00:47:42,646 --> 00:47:43,966
What is all this?

688
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,300
Returning this room
to its proper appearance.

689
00:47:47,425 --> 00:47:50,421
Say what you will about the Targaryens,
they were conquerors.

690
00:47:50,546 --> 00:47:52,914
That is a seat for a conqueror.

691
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,153
It needs a room to match it,
not vines and flowers.

692
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:58,709
We can't find Arya Stark.

693
00:47:59,145 --> 00:48:01,188
With luck, she's dead
in a ditch somewhere.

694
00:48:01,313 --> 00:48:03,363
Perhaps. But if not, we need her.

695
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:05,648
They'll never give Jaime back to us
for Sansa alone.

696
00:48:05,773 --> 00:48:07,806
I think they might.
They're weak.

697
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,179
They put too much value
on their women.

698
00:48:11,211 --> 00:48:13,970
We need to set our armies
to the task of finding her.

699
00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:16,196
Send out as many men as we can.

700
00:48:16,321 --> 00:48:17,867
I'm sure if you asked grandfather...

701
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,049
The King does not ask, he commands.

702
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:24,598
And my grandfather's stupidity
in the field of battle

703
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:27,548
is the reason Robb Stark has
Uncle Jaime in the first place.

704
00:48:27,673 --> 00:48:29,500
His life is in danger.

705
00:48:30,564 --> 00:48:31,672
We're at war.

706
00:48:32,248 --> 00:48:34,023
All our lives are in danger.

707
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,546
I heard a disgusting lie
about Uncle Jaime.

708
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:43,129
And you.

709
00:48:44,497 --> 00:48:46,882
Our enemies will say anything
to weaken your claim to the throne.

710
00:48:48,093 --> 00:48:50,010
It's not a claim.
The throne is mine.

711
00:48:51,891 --> 00:48:53,135
Of course it is.

712
00:48:55,655 --> 00:48:57,393
No one believes this foul gossip.

713
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,841
Someone believes it.

714
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:02,801
Father had other children?

715
00:49:03,833 --> 00:49:05,985
Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?

716
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:09,905
What are you asking?

717
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:13,242
I'm asking if he fucked other women
when he grew tired of you.

718
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:15,703
How many bastards
does he have running...

719
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:34,346
What you just did
is punishable by death.

720
00:49:39,244 --> 00:49:40,815
You will never do it again.

721
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:42,974
Never.

722
00:49:49,955 --> 00:49:51,604
That will be all, Mother.

723
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:03,011
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

724
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:05,002
Ease into it.

725
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,582
Slowly, with passion.

726
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,600
Go wash yourselves.
Put some clothes on.

727
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:18,124
Both of you are working tonight.

728
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,225
We do things differently here, Daisy.

729
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:28,102
This isn't some five-copper
bawdy house in Hayseed Hall.

730
00:50:28,227 --> 00:50:30,785
- Haystack Hall.
- Wherever you're from.

731
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,707
Our establishment doesn't cater

732
00:50:32,832 --> 00:50:34,682
to ploughmen and goat herders.

733
00:50:35,685 --> 00:50:36,914
Lord Olsen.

734
00:50:37,847 --> 00:50:39,346
Taste is everything here.

735
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:41,370
Littlefinger's a fancy man.

736
00:50:41,495 --> 00:50:44,416
Don't call him Littlefinger.
He doesn't like it.

737
00:50:44,881 --> 00:50:46,444
Lord Baelish.

738
00:50:52,711 --> 00:50:54,629
She pretends she doesn't speak
the common tongue

739
00:50:54,754 --> 00:50:57,045
so that people
will think she's exotic.

740
00:50:57,546 --> 00:51:00,198
She grew up just down the road
in Flea Bottom.

741
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,519
She's beautiful.

742
00:51:02,989 --> 00:51:06,357
She's a dumb slut, really,
but a lid for every pot.

743
00:51:11,608 --> 00:51:12,837
Lord Commander.

744
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,490
Good to see you again.

745
00:51:31,742 --> 00:51:34,466
You do realize this establishment
is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish,

746
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:37,755
the King's Master of Coin...

747
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,638
Coin which goes in many pockets.

748
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,223
Orders.

749
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,361
Whose orders?

750
00:51:42,486 --> 00:51:45,352
Someone who doesn't care
what Littlefinger thinks.

751
00:52:03,197 --> 00:52:06,110
No, you can't.
No! Please!

752
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,293
Not my Barra!

753
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:12,880
Get it done.

754
00:52:13,541 --> 00:52:14,840
Kill the bastard.

755
00:52:15,422 --> 00:52:17,301
- Please.
- Give it here.

756
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:32,238
Spread out.
Search every house.

757
00:52:32,363 --> 00:52:34,568
Every room.
Look in every room.

758
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:01,804
Gendry!
His name is Gendry.

759
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,707
Where is the bastard?

760
00:53:03,832 --> 00:53:06,651
The Night's Watch!
Please, stop!

761
00:53:06,776 --> 00:53:07,768
Where?

762
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,813
They took him up the Kingsroad,
heading north.

763
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:14,441
- How will we know him?
- He's got a bull's head helmet.

764
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:15,937
He made it himself.

765
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,403
Find him.
